"""Built-in chat agent: an Anthropic Messages API tool-use loop.

The engine renders its tool list from the shared ToolRegistry (the same source
the MCP server uses), runs each turn as an asyncio background task, and
publishes progress on the EventBus so the UI can stream it over the WebSocket:

    {"type": "chat_delta",       "project": ..., "session": ..., "text": ...}
    {"type": "chat_tool_call",   "project": ..., "session": ..., "name": ...,
     "args": ...}
    {"type": "chat_tool_result", "project": ..., "session": ..., "name": ...,
     "ok": bool,
     "result": <JSON string, truncated to 2000 chars; any png_base64 is
                replaced with "<image omitted>">}
    {"type": "chat_done",        "project": ..., "session": ..., "turn_id": ...}

History is kept in memory per (project, session) for the server's lifetime.
A session is a named conversation lane within a project (id matching
``[a-z0-9_-]{1,32}``, default "main" — the browser dock's lane), so several
agents can hold independent conversations about one project. Turns are
serialized per (project, session) with an asyncio.Lock — the user message is
appended inside the lock — so concurrent POST /api/chat calls cannot
interleave one session's history and break the Messages API
tool_use/tool_result pairing; turns in *different* sessions run concurrently
(cross-session write consistency is the per-project turn lock's job, see
agentcad.core.locks). If a turn dies between issuing tool_use and recording
results, the history is repaired with synthetic error tool_results before the
lock is released.

Tool calls run under client identity "chat" for the default session and
"chat:<session>" otherwise, so a turn lock acquired by a session names it.

SYSTEM_PROMPT = """\
You are the AgentCAD assistant — an agentic CAD copilot inside AgentCAD, a parametric
CAD system where every part is a Python script built with build123d (OpenCascade
B-rep). You operate on projects exclusively through the provided tools; the geometry
kernel validates every change and returns real metrics (volume mm^3, mass g, area,
bounding box, center of mass, validity).

Part-script contract (summary):
- A part script defines PARAMS, a dict of typed parameter specs
  ({"name": {"default": ..., "min": ..., "max": ..., "unit": ..., "description": ...}}
  with "default" required and the rest optional; an optional "type" of "number"
  (the default), "int", "bool", "enum" (requires "choices"), or "string" enables
  non-numeric parameters), and a function build(p) that
  receives the resolved parameter values as attributes (p.name) and returns a
  build123d Part, Solid, or Compound.
- Units are millimeters; angles are degrees. Numeric overrides outside min/max are
  clamped with warnings; wrong-typed values and unknown parameter names are errors.

Working rules:
- Call the part_template tool before writing your first part script in a
  conversation — it returns the contract, a starter script and the build123d
  basics, so you do not have to guess the API. Then call load_skill for the
  craft guide that matches the task (snap-fits, enclosures, sheet metal, FEM,
  …) and follow it while you write the geometry.
- When a rebuild fails you receive a structured error with the traceback and failing
  line; read it, fix the script, and retry rather than giving up. The previous good
  geometry is kept while a script is broken.
- Prefer small verifiable steps: make one change, read the returned metrics or error,
  then continue.
- Always end your reply with a short summary of what changed (projects/parts created
  or updated, parameters set, exports written) — or say explicitly that nothing
  changed.

        The default session keeps the plain "chat" identity; any other session
        is stamped "chat:<session>" so a turn lock it acquires names the lane
        that holds it. Executor threads do not inherit the event-loop task's
        contextvars, and a reused worker thread keeps whatever its ambient
        context last held — so **both** the identity and the tenant are set
        explicitly at the start of every call rather than relying on
        per-work-item context isolation.

        Why the tenant is threaded in rather than the whole context copied: the
        chat is deliberately attributed as the ``"chat"`` principal, which
        ``audit.current_principal_id`` reads by finding **no** HTTP principal in
        this thread's context. A ``copy_context()`` of the request would carry
        ``security``'s principal ContextVar across too, and the audit row would
        name the human who typed the message instead of the chat agent. Setting
        the one ContextVar that is genuinely missing keeps the thread's context
        otherwise clean — ``current_config`` still resolves via the module-level
        config, so the floor check, the audit tap and the tenant-rooted store
        all see the right tenant. ``tenant is None`` (local mode) sets and
        restores ``None``, so AC7 is untouched.
