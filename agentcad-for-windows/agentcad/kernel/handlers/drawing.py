"""Worker handler: 2D engineering drawings (projected views + dimensions).

Projects a part to front/top/right/iso views via build123d's HLR
(project_to_viewport), renders visible (solid) and hidden (dashed) edges to a
hand-rolled SVG, and overlays an annotation layer: per-view overall
dimensions plus diameter callouts for circles detected in the top view. Also
emits DXF (visible edges) via ezdxf. Values are measured from the projected
geometry, not copied from parameters.

Optional ``params["pmi"]`` (the part's normalized PMI section, see
agentcad/core/pmi.py) adds a GD&T callout layer to the SVG: tolerance
suffixes on the overall/diameter dimensions, boxed datum flags with leaders,
and a column of feature control frames above the title block.
``detected["pmi_rendered"]`` counts what was actually drawn and
``detected["pmi_warnings"]`` names PMI entries that could not be placed.
DXF output ignores PMI (v1).

Optional ``params["dim_table"]`` (PRD-012) adds a boxed **dimension table** in
the sheet's clear right column: one row per configuration, its configured
parameters, and the overall X/Y/Z extents of that configuration's own built
shape. The rows are built and measured *here* — the module's contract is that
a drawing prints what the geometry is, and a table of parameters the caller
already had would assert nothing. A member that will not build is one row of
em dashes with its error, never the loss of the sheet.
``detected["dim_table"]`` echoes the whole thing structurally. DXF ignores it.

Hole callouts read the part's **hole records** when it has them (PRD-010): the
records ride on the built shape, this handler already builds it, so they are
read in-process — no second kernel call and no service round trip. A record
that matches a detected circle group by diameter *and* centre prints its
designation (``8× M5×0.8 - 6H ↧12``) and marks that group
``from_metadata: true``; a group with no record keeps the measured text
(``8× ⌀6.60``) and ``from_metadata: false``. The distinction is the point: a
⌀4.2 circle on a projection cannot tell a drilled hole from an M5 tap, and only
the record knows which one the author meant.

**A record is intent; a drawing is a measurement, and where they disagree the
drawing wins.** ``holes.carry()`` moves records across later operations without
re-verifying them, by design, so this handler re-measures **four specific
things** before asserting them — not "everything", and the difference is the
list:

* the printed **count** is the circles actually matched, never the record's;
* a record whose **designation is not what its own fields spell** is skipped
  with a warning (``hole_standards.validate_record``, the same contract the
  harvest raises on and the sidecar discards on — this used to be a five-field
  spot-check, so a plausible dict `setattr`-ed onto the shape printed a
  fabricated callout);
* a blind record's **bottom**: one point classified just past the recorded
  depth. Gone ⇒ the callout drops the depth and the recorded number travels in
  ``hole_warnings``, where it cannot be read as a dimension;
* a counterbore's or countersink's **seat**: four points around its outer
  radius at its own mid-depth, plus one inside it. Nothing in material at any
  azimuth, or the seat's own space no longer empty ⇒ the callout drops the
  seat. Both degradations are spelled by ``designation_for_record`` from a
  modified copy of the record, so a degraded callout uses the same grammar as
  an honest one.

**What is NOT re-measured, and must not be read as if it were.** Each field is
exactly what it is named and nothing more. ``bottom_present`` catches a hole
made deeper and not one made SHALLOWER, because milling the part's top down
leaves the bottom precisely where the record says it is — measured, a 6 mm
blind M8 on a 12 mm plate with 3 mm taken off the top prints ``↧6`` over a 3 mm
hole, ``bottom_present: true``, byte-identical to the control.
``seat_present`` is **"nothing surrounds it at any of four azimuths at its
mid-depth, or its space is not empty"** — that sentence and no wider one. It
therefore catches a seat region milled off completely and a pocket filled back
in, and it does **not** catch a seat milled off that leaves anything at one
azimuth (a 2×2 mm pin reads ``true``), a slot cut across it leaving 0.25 mm
crescents (reads ``true``), or a diameter/depth/angle that changed. That is the
`any` bias, and it is measured rather than assumed: a bounding-box-filtered
``all`` catches the pin and the slot, keeps both edge cases — and reads
``false`` on a CORRECT counterbore beside an ordinary pocket, which is
degrading a true drawing on a routine layout. The recorded **diameter** is not
re-measured against the circle it matched beyond ``_HOLE_DIA_TOL``, and nothing
on a face other than the top is measured at all. Measuring a hole's true depth
means finding where its wall begins, which is a ray cast into a projection this
handler does not build; guessing it would be worse than the gap.

**Known limitation, inherited and deliberate: this reads the TOP VIEW only.**
``_detect_circles`` collects closed CIRCLE edges from the top projection, so a
hole on a side face has a perfect record and no callout — and a drawing with
no top view has none at all. Rather than partially patch it here, every record
that could not be drawn is named in ``detected["hole_warnings"]``; making side
views carry callouts is PRD-014's job.

Also inherited: ``_detect_circles`` only reports a *geometric* group at
``count >= 3``. A record is drawn whatever its count — a single tapped hole is
a callout — so the threshold applies to guessing, not to intent.

      was the round-4 finding: two seats machined off the top still printed
      `⌀9 ⌴⌀14.5↧8.8` and `⌀6.6 ⌵⌀13.44×90°`, byte-identical to the control;

      against the control's 429 198 (*above* it), and the outer probe alone
      read `true` with no warning at any sampling density, because "is there
      material around the seat" is not "is the seat a void".

    * the seat region milled off with **anything left at one azimuth** — a
      2×2 mm pin (volume 303 967 against 429 198) reads `true`;
    * a **slot milled across it** leaving 0.25 mm crescents at ±X (volume
      415 856) reads `true`;
    * a seat whose **diameter, depth or angle changed** while remaining a void
      in material.

    Both misses follow from `any` rather than `all`, and that bias is a
    measured choice, not an oversight. A bounding-box-filtered `all` catches
    the pin and the slot and keeps both edge cases — but it reads `false` on a
    **correct** counterbore with an ordinary pocket touching or overlapping its
