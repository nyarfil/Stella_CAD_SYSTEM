"""Worker handler pack for executable design specs (PRD-003).

Three methods, all of them primitives the service orchestrates:

* ``spec_declare`` — execute a part script or a project ``specs.py`` and report
  the ``SPECS`` it declares, JSON-safe. **It never builds**: a declaration must
  be readable on a part that does not build, which is what makes the spec list
  visible before any geometry exists.
* ``spec_eval`` — build the part and evaluate the *shape tier*
  (``valid``/``mass``/``volume``/``bbox``/``wall``/``that``) against the built
  shape and its metrics. Everything else in the vocabulary is a named skip.
* ``clearance`` — the minimum distance between two world-placed items, via
  ``BRepExtrema_DistShapeShape``. The one genuinely new geometry op in the
  feature.

The rules this file is written around:

* **A ``check_that`` predicate never leaves this process.** It is a Python
  callable read out of the script's own namespace (the ``connectors(p, part)``
  / ``analysis(p)`` seam, via ``build_shape_ns``), executed here with
  ``(part, metrics)``, and replaced by ``"predicate": true`` on the way out.
  Predicates are untrusted script code and the server process must never run
  them.
* **A predicate must not be able to change another check's verdict.** It is
  script code holding a reference to shared state, so each check is handed its
  own ``deepcopy`` of the metrics dict and every ``that`` check is evaluated
  **last** — a predicate that writes ``metrics["mass_g"] = 0`` then cannot turn
  a failing ``check_mass`` green. Records are still emitted in declared order.
  Evaluation order is therefore not a contract a predicate may rely on: the
  built-in kinds run first, ``that`` predicates run afterwards in declared
  order among themselves. The built *shape* is shared and cannot be copied —
  a predicate that mutates the B-rep is out of scope, exactly as a ``build``
  that does is.
* **``_min_wall`` is imported from the sibling analysis pack, never
  re-implemented.** Two implementations of wall thickness is the worst outcome
  available. The same reasoning is why ``_exec_script``, ``_item_shape`` and
  ``_script_error_from_exc`` are imported from ``worker`` rather than mirrored
  here — ``motion.py`` already takes that back-edge for
  ``pairwise_interference``, and the import happens inside ``register()``,
  which only runs once ``worker`` is fully imported.
* **A broken check is payload; a broken ``SPECS`` is an error.** Every
  per-check evaluation is guarded on its own and degrades to an ``error``
  record carrying ``details.traceback``/``details.line``; only a structural
  problem (``SPECS`` is not a list, or holds something no constructor produced)
  raises ``contract_error``, and a constructor rejecting its own argument
  raises ``script_error`` with a line number while the module executes — the
  ``PARAMS`` contract verbatim.
* **``clearance`` measures the ``analysis(p)`` envelope** when a script defines
  one, exactly as ``interference`` does. An envelope contains the real part, so
  the reported distance is an *under*-estimate — conservative in the safe
  direction. A mesh (STL) side is skipped because the query has no solution on
  a welded mesh Face (measured; see ``docs/changelog/0088-*``), ``SetDeflection``
  is left at its exact default (an approximate distance reported as a
  measurement would be dishonest), and a zero distance is simply the
  interference case: this handler does not also try to be
  ``check_interference_free``.

Records are emitted without an ``id`` or a ``part`` field: the worker does not
know which part it is building. ``SpecRunner`` joins them on ``index`` and adds
``<part>:<name>``.
