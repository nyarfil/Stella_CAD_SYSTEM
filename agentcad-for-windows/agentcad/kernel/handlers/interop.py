"""Worker handler pack: interop exports (PRD-017).

``export_step_pmi`` writes a STEP AP242 file carrying the part's PMI (our
``core/pmi.py`` model mapped to XCAF by ``_pmi_map``, which owns the six traps
the de-risking spike found). ``read_step_pmi`` reads PMI back out — the
round-trip half of the export's contract and what the test suite asserts on:
PMI entry identity does not survive the writer (labels are overwritten by the
STEP type keyword), so entries are matched by (type, value, tolerance, target)
and datums by *name*, never by label count (a two-datum FCF reads back as three
datum labels).

``export_3mf_rich`` (slice 5, FR4–FR5) writes 3MF with per-solid names and
colours and model metadata. The one trap it owns is the spike's D.1:
``Mesher.add_shape(Part)`` **silently drops both** ``.label`` and ``.color``
(``Mesher`` reads them only off a ``Solid``), so today's plain 3MF has no names
and no colours even when the script set them. This handler decomposes to
``shape.solids()`` and stamps each solid before it is added. ``CreationDate``
is whatever the server passed — the resolved *version* date, never a wall
clock, because a 3MF is already non-deterministic enough (lib3mf mints a fresh
``p:UUID`` per object per write; spike D.2).

``export_step_structured`` (slice 5, FR2) writes a real STEP **assembly**: one
XCAF product per unique part, one component per instance, names on both,
colours through ``XCAFDoc_ColorTool``, AP242. It is the mirror image of
``interop_import``'s walk, and it inherits two traps of its own beyond
``_pmi_map``'s six:

* a product's shape must be a **``TopoDS_Solid`` when it has exactly one
  solid** — added as a single-solid ``TopoDS_Compound`` the product colour
  still survives, but every *per-occurrence* colour override is dropped by the
  writer (measured: 2 styled items, the override absent from the file);
* a genuinely multi-solid product keeps its compound, and then its colour is
  written **per solid** — which our own ``inspect_cad_tree`` reports as
  ``color: None`` on the product, because on re-read those styles land on
  sub-shape labels. Per-occurrence overrides on a multi-solid product are lost.
  Recorded here rather than worked around: the fix is a product per (part,
  colour) pair, which would inflate the product count the round trip asserts.

Parts without PMI keep the plain ``export`` path — this pack adds methods, it
replaces none.
