"""Worker handler pack for the geometric diff between two part versions.

``geom_diff`` builds both sides, differences them both ways (``new - old`` is
the added material, ``old - new`` the removed material) and reports the two
volumes plus, optionally, an ACM1 mesh of each so a viewer can overlay them.

Three traps this handler is written around:

* **Volumes come from ``shape_volume``, never ``.volume``** — a boolean result
  is routinely a *nested* Compound, and ``Compound.volume`` reports only the
  first child subtree.
* **Mesh-kind references (imported STL) are never booleaned** — an STL loads as
  one welded Face and an OCCT boolean on it segfaults the worker. Such a side
  is named in ``skipped_mesh`` and both volumes come back ``0.0``.
* **Every boolean is guarded** — an OCCT failure becomes a structured
  ``kernel_error`` carrying ``details.stage``, so the caller can degrade to
  "geometric diff unavailable" with its other evidence intact.

Unlike ``&`` (see ``worker.pairwise_interference``), the ``-`` operator is
correct on multi-solid Compound operands; the measurement is in
``docs/changelog/0079-geometric-diff-kernel-handler.md``.
