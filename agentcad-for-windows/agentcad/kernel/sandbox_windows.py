"""Windows confinement and quotas: an AppContainer, and a job object per worker.

The backend half of :mod:`agentcad.kernel.sandbox` for ``sys.platform ==
"win32"``. Two halves, and they are applied by two different mechanisms:

* **Quotas** are a job object. It caps committed memory
  (``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_PROCESS_MEMORY`` — an allocation over the limit *fails*,
  so a runaway script gets a ``MemoryError`` with a line number and the warm
  worker survives), the number of processes it may start
  (``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_ACTIVE_PROCESS``) and its CPU share
  (``JobObjectCpuRateControlInformation``, a hard cap that throttles). Closing
  the job handle kills whatever is still in it
  (``JOB_OBJECT_LIMIT_KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE``), which is how an orphaned worker's
  children go away with it.
* **Confinement** is an AppContainer (PRD-006b, design spec Decisions 1-4).
  The worker runs under a **lowbox token** built from a per-installation
  package SID (``CreateAppContainerProfile``, re-derived on later runs) with
  **no capabilities at all** — the absence of ``INTERNET_CLIENT`` *is* the
  network denial (``WSAEACCES``/``[WinError 10013]``) — and the only paths it
  can reach are the ones carrying an ACE for that SID: the plan's write roots
  and private temp dir at ``M``, the interpreter, the venv and the app tree at
  ``RX`` (:func:`acl_grant`, ``icacls``). Everything else on the machine —
  the user's home, another worker's scratch, ``C:\\Users\\Public`` — answers
  ``[Errno 13]``.

  CPython's ``subprocess`` cannot pass
  ``PROC_THREAD_ATTRIBUTE_SECURITY_CAPABILITIES``, so a confined worker is
  started by :class:`ConfinedProcess` — ``CreateProcessW`` +
  ``STARTUPINFOEX`` through ctypes, with exactly the ``Popen`` surface the
  client uses — which the client reaches through :meth:`WindowsBackend.spawn`.
  It starts **suspended**, joins the job object, and only then resumes, so
  there is no window in which the worker runs unquotaed (Decision 4).

  Honesty (Decision 3/8): this module only ever *intends* the confinement. The
  worker reads ``TokenIsAppContainer`` off **its own token** in
  ``_preamble.apply_from_env`` and reports it back on ``ping``; a plan whose
  worker answers anything else is downgraded to ``off`` by
  ``client.confinement_holds`` and ``sandbox.report``. A profile, an ACL or a
  spawn that failed is ``off`` **here**, with the step and the path in
  ``warnings`` — never ``active`` by intent — and a Windows too old for
  ``userenv!CreateAppContainerProfile`` (or a machine with no ``icacls``) is
  ``unsupported``.

The job is created and **configured in** :func:`build`, in the server process,
before anything is spawned: the process is only *assigned* to it after
``Popen``. That ordering is what lets ``quotas.mechanism`` name ``job_object``
honestly — a mechanism string is a promise, and at plan time the job either
exists with its limits written or the tier reports itself off (Decision 8).
The assignment race is benign and recorded: the worker does nothing but import
until its first request.

**The handle ``Popen`` hands back is not the interpreter.** A Windows venv's
``python.exe`` — uv-managed ones included — is a *launcher*: it starts the real
interpreter as a **child** and stays around as a thin stub. The child inherits
the job object (which is why the commit limit bites the interpreter and a
balloon still gets its ``MemoryError``), but ``GetProcessMemoryInfo`` on
``proc._handle`` measures the stub, and answered ~3.9 MB for a worker with
build123d imported (Windows CI, changelog 0238). So :meth:`WindowsBackend.rss_bytes`
samples **the job's own process list** and reports the **largest** working set
in it — the interpreter dominates, and a sum would double-count the pages the
two share. The ``Popen`` handle stays as the fallback for a worker with no job
(``attach`` failed) or a query Windows refused.

Every ``ctypes.WinDLL`` lookup is inside a function, so this module imports
cleanly on macOS and Linux — which is what lets the plan-shape test run on
every OS with these entry points stubbed. No ``OCP``/build123d here either.
