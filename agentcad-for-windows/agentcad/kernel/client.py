"""KernelClient: owns the worker subprocess.

Spawns ``python -m agentcad.kernel.worker``, sends line-delimited JSON
requests, enforces per-request timeouts, and kills/respawns the worker on
hangs, crashes, or EOF. Thread-safe; one request in flight at a time.

With ``writable_dirs`` or ``quotas`` it spawns through a
:class:`~agentcad.kernel.sandbox.SandboxPlan`: the worker is confined, capped,
and given a private temp dir, all decided once so every respawn is identical.
With neither (the default, and what the test suite's session fixture uses) the
argv, the environment and the lifecycle are byte-for-byte the historical ones.
