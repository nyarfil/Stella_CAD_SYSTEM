"""Request authorization for hosted mode: default deny, with one allowlist.

**Not `kernel/sandbox.py`.** That module is *process confinement* and PRD-006
owns it. This one is *request authorization*. Neither is the other, and on
Linux the first does not exist yet — which is the fact the whole feature is
built around (design spec, Decision 1).

The shape, in one paragraph. ``create_app`` takes an explicit
``security=SecurityConfig`` and its one middleware delegates here; with
``security=None`` the middleware runs today's local code path *unchanged*, so
"local mode is untouched" is a property of the diff rather than a test we have
to keep passing. Everything not named in :data:`PUBLIC_PATHS` /
:data:`PUBLIC_PREFIXES` is ``401`` — a route pack added tomorrow is private
with no action by its author, and there is deliberately **no** per-route
``@public`` decorator, because a pack author must not be able to open the
anonymous surface from their own file.

**Why this is not a discovered pack.** ``_mount_route_packs`` and
``_load_tool_packs`` both fail *open*: a module with no ``router`` is silently
skipped. A security middleware that silently failed to load would leave the
instance wide open with no signal anywhere. Auth is constructed explicitly by
the caller and fails closed. That is the entire argument for the one
sanctioned ``app.py`` edit (design spec, Decision 7).

The guard, in the order Decision 7 fixes:

1. No config (local mode) → not our business; the caller runs today's path.
2. ``Host`` must equal the configured public origin's host.
3. Resolve a principal: ``Authorization: Bearer`` first, then the session
   cookie.
4. State-changing methods that are not bearer-authenticated: an ``Origin``,
   when present, must equal the configured public origin → else ``403``.
   **Before** the anonymous branch, because ``login`` and ``enrol`` are the
   only anonymous unsafe methods and are exactly what it protects.
5. No principal + a public path → allow, anonymously, with **no** client id.
6. No principal + anything else → ``401``.
7. ``set_client_id`` the composed principal, **after** ``check_client_id``
   validation — closing the gap where the ContextVar is set unvalidated today.
8. Roles are checked in ``routes_auth.py``, not here: there are five
   admin-only handlers and a path-pattern list would be a second place to get
   it wrong.

    Precedence, and the reason for each rung:

    1. **A bearer token's scope.** A scoped token *is* a tenant statement made
       by the admin who minted it, so nothing the caller sends may redirect it
       — the header is not even read when a scope is present, and the
       membership check below is not applied to it (FR3: an agent is never an
       org member, so requiring membership would make every token unusable).
    2. **``X-Agentcad-Workspace: org/ws``** — how an API client, the MCP
       server and a browser that has switched workspaces say where they are.
       When the header is absent, **``?workspace=org/ws``** stands in for it at
       the same rung (:class:`_ws_headers`): the header wins when both are
       present, and the query is what a header-less ``<img src>`` GET, a
       ``sendBeacon`` and a ``WebSocket`` use. Both are only a *selection* — a
       scoped token above still wins, and the membership check below still
       applies, so neither can reach a workspace this principal cannot see.
    3. **The session's active workspace**, when the session row carries one
       (slice 8's switcher writes it; today it never does).
    4. **The principal's own memberships**, when they name exactly one
       ``(org, workspace)`` — a single-org instance then needs no header at
       all. With several, the alphabetically first is the default, stated here
       rather than discovered: dropping such a caller to the untenanted root
       instead would quietly create their projects outside every org.
    5. Otherwise **``None``** — local mode, and a hosted instance with no orgs
       (a PRD-005a instance), which is byte-for-byte what it was.

    **Every rung is checked against the roles document.** A selection is only
    a selection; the answer to "may this principal be there at all" is
    ``authz.role_of(..., proj=None)``, and a selection that fails it is a
    **name-free 404** rather than a 403 — a 403 would confirm that the org and
    workspace exist, which is the existence oracle FR5 forbids. A malformed
    header is the one exception: it is a client bug, it confirms nothing, and
    it gets a 400 that says so.
