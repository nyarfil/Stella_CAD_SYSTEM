"""Thumbnail routes (PRD-027 FR4) — the part and assembly preview images.

    GET /api/projects/{proj}/parts/{part_id}/thumb.png[?k=<key>]
    GET /api/projects/{proj}/thumb.png[?k=<key>]

Its own pack rather than lines in `routes_configs`, so the thumbnail slice and
the search slice could be built side by side (design Decision 0), and because
what these two routes share is a caching contract, not a subject.

**This is the first non-`no-store` binary response in the codebase.** Every
mesh, render and drawing route answers `Cache-Control: no-store`, deliberately:
they are addressed by *part id*, so a cached copy would go stale the moment the
part rebuilt. These are addressed by **content hash** — `k` is the cache key the
client already learned from `get_project`'s `thumb_key` (or from a
`rebuild_finished` event, which now carries `cache_key`). So:

* `k` equals the key we are about to serve → the client named this exact
  content, and the answer can be `immutable` for a year. A rebuild mints a new
  key, so the browser asks for a different URL; nothing can be stale.
* `k` absent, malformed or stale → `no-cache`. The response is still returned in
  full and the browser revalidates next time with `If-None-Match`, which is a
  cheap 304 here because the ETag is the key and computing it needs no render.

A malformed `k` is **ignored, not refused**: it can only cost the client the
immutable answer, and a 422 on a cache hint would break an `<img>` tag for a
typo. Both routes are member-only by default-deny — nothing here joins
`PUBLIC_PATHS`.

Neither route ever builds. `thumbnails.part_thumb` / `assembly_thumb` render
only from meshes already on disk, so a dashboard opening twenty projects walks
twenty cache directories and starts zero kernel requests.
