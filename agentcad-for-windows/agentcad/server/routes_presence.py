"""Presence routes: who is on this project, over HTTP (PRD-008 slice 6).

    POST /api/projects/{proj}/presence  {part_id?, surface?, label?, claim?,
                                         leave?}  -> {you, clients, claims,
                                                      ttl_s, heartbeat_s}
    GET  /api/projects/{proj}/presence            -> the same payload, and
                                                     registers nobody
    POST /api/projects/{proj}/claims/override  {part} -> {armed_until, claim}

The heartbeat is also where a **claim** is taken: ``claim: true`` says "this
client's editor buffer is dirty, or a control is being dragged", and
*viewing* never claims. Everything else about claims — the precedence rule,
the human-vs-human restriction, the turn-holder exemption — lives in
``core/locks.py`` and ``core/presence.py``; this pack only carries them in.

Why HTTP and not the WebSocket the PRD's FR9 imagines: ``/ws`` is in
``server/app.py``, a core this feature may not edit; it carries no client
identity, because ``set_client_id`` is HTTP middleware; and its Host guard is
HTTP middleware too — a route pack cannot see ``create_app``'s
``allowed_hosts``, so it could not reproduce that guard correctly. The
substance of FR9 (report focus, see others) is met; the transport is the
reviewed one. See design Decision 13.

The identity is **the request's** — the ``X-Agent-Id`` the app's middleware
bound — and never an argument, with exactly one documented exception: a
``pagehide`` beacon. ``navigator.sendBeacon`` cannot set headers, so the leave
carries ``client_id`` in its body. That grants nobody anything: the header is
itself unvalidated and self-asserted (identity here is bookkeeping, not
authentication), and the worst a forged leave can do is drop a roster row that
the sender's next 15-second heartbeat puts straight back — and that the TTL
would have dropped within 45 s regardless. The stated blast radius is the
*whole* blast radius: a leave touches the roster and nothing else. It
deliberately does **not** release the leaver's claims, because that would make
a forged beacon a way to disarm the protection another human is editing under,
and a claim already expires on its own in 90 s. Nothing else on this router
reads an identity from a body.

Every identity that reaches this router is bounded first
(``presence.check_identity``) — at the *route*, not only inside the registry,
because the rate limiter allocates a bucket keyed by the raw string and runs
before the roster does. An id longer than ``MAX_ID_CHARS`` is a 422 rather than
a truncation: two ids cut to the same 64 characters would be one client to the
roster, the claims and the mentions. This router is **not** the only door,
which is why the check itself lives in ``locks.check_client_id``: a part write
reaches the claim registry from the write guard carrying the same header and
never passes through here at all.

The response is the mechanism. Every call, including a throttled one, answers
with the whole roster, so a client that misses every ``presence_changed``
converges within one heartbeat. That is also why over-rate calls are HTTP 200
with ``throttled: true`` rather than a 429: a heartbeat must never surface as
an error in a status indicator.
