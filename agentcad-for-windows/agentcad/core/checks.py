"""Geometry CI: the report shape, its two renderings and its verdict.

This module is the *reporting* half of ``agentcad check`` (PRD-004). It is
pure — dicts in, dicts, strings and ints out — so the contract every later
slice is written against is provable without building a single solid, and so
the report can be validated by a consumer that has no kernel.

Three rules it is written around:

* **It composes; it never measures.** Every number in a report came from a
  surface that already exists and is reviewed (``service._ensure_built``,
  ``check_interference``, ``SpecRunner.run``, the drawing tools). Nothing here
  computes geometry, and an ``error`` field is the payload a tool returned,
  **verbatim** — the same ``details.traceback``, ``details.line`` and Error
  Doctor ``details.hint`` an agent already knows how to fix (FR7).
* **Rows are ``items``, never ``checks``.** ``checks`` already means three
  things in this codebase: the built-in gate name in
  ``ProposalManager.gates()``, ``report["checks"]`` in every ``SpecRunner``
  report, and the proposals UI's "Checks" tab. A fourth meaning would be a bug
  generator. Likewise ``status`` is the four-value row status and ``state`` is
  the gate's — they are not interchangeable.
* **No new status vocabulary.** :func:`summarize`, :func:`report_status`,
  :func:`group_requirements` and :func:`assign_ids` are imported from
  :mod:`agentcad.core.specs`, not restated. Row statuses are PRD-003's four
  (``pass``/``fail``/``skip``/``error``), summary counts its five, stage and
  report statuses its three (``green``/``red``/``skip``).

And one policy, which is the whole difference between this surface and the
proposal gate (design Decision 6): **a check report is honest.** A skip stays
a skip, with its reason and its hint; ``--strict`` changes only the *derived*
``status`` and ``exit_code`` and records which rows it counted, so a reader can
always tell what was measured from what was demanded. PRD-003's ``specs`` gate
is the fail-closed reading of the same measurements, and it stays that way.

And one containment rule, which is the whole of ``--ref`` (design Decision 5):
**a check never mutates the project it measures.** Checking a ref materializes
the resolved *commit* into a throwaway detached ``git worktree`` and drives a
second, ephemeral :class:`AgentCADService` rooted there — with its event bus
and its branch resolver muzzled, because either one left live would write into
the user's real repository through the link. The price is stated rather than
hidden: a ref check runs on a **cold cache**.

Nothing here imports ``OCP`` or build123d, directly or transitively — this is
server-process code and a test asserts it.

class CheckRunner:
    """The four stages, in order, over one project — and nothing else.

    Every stage is a call into a surface that already exists and is reviewed:
    ``service._ensure_built`` per manifest part, ``_resolved_instances`` +
    ``check_interference``, ``SpecRunner.run``, and the registered
    ``generate_drawing`` / ``flat_pattern`` tools. This class orders them,
    budgets them, and turns their results into rows. **It measures nothing**,
    which is why it needs no kernel handler and imports no geometry.

    Two rules the code encodes and a reader should not have to rediscover:

    * **Nothing is captured in ``__init__``.** ``service.specs`` and
      ``service.branches`` are installed by packs that load *after*
      ``tools_run_checks`` (``s`` and ``v`` after ``r``), so they are read
      inside the methods that use them — a runner built at registration time
      would otherwise capture ``None`` forever.
    * **A failing, skipped or errored item is payload, never an exception.**
      The only exceptions that leave :meth:`run` are the harness's own —
      an unknown project (``NotFoundError``) or an unknown stage
      (``ValidationError``) — because those mean *we could not produce a
      verdict*, which is exit 2, not a red report.

    Every completed run leaves two traces behind, in :meth:`run` rather than in
    any one caller, so the CLI, the ``run_checks`` tool and the route behave
    identically: a ``check_finished`` event on the bus, and the report in
    :attr:`last` (bounded to :data:`LAST_REPORTS` projects, in memory only).

    ``budget_s`` is a **deadline read before every item and every kernel
    call**, on ``time.monotonic`` (an NTP step must never move a budget). Every
    stage is under it: the two assembly calls take what is left as their
    ``timeout_s``, the specs stage passes the remainder into
    ``SpecRunner.run(deadline=…)`` (PRD-003 bounds each tier with it), and the
    determinism row re-reads it before each of its four calls. Below
    :data:`_MIN_CALL_S` nothing is issued at all, because a call that cannot
    finish can only overshoot and then be reported as a timeout — a red row for
    something the budget did. The honest limitation, which is also in
    ``--help`` and the docs: ``service._ensure_built`` hard-codes 300 s and the
    drawing tools 120 s, neither taking a ``timeout_s``, so the worst-case
    overshoot is **one in-flight kernel call** — and when that call is the
    *last* item, the report stays complete and says so in ``warnings``
    (:meth:`_note_overshoot`).

    An instance is either **shared** (``service.checks``, which the CLI, the
    chat agent, the tool and the route all reach for) or a **run context**
    (:meth:`_run_context`). Only the second one carries a deadline, and only
    the second one is ever mutated: sharing execution policy between concurrent
    runs is what review C3 was.

        replaces a built-in gate of the same name, so this becomes *the* checks
        gate rather than a sixth one beside the placeholder.

        ==========  =====================================================

        **``pending`` is deliberately absent**, and this is the one place this

        else*, so ``pending`` is merge-**permissive**: a green posted against
        an older commit would have waved through content it never measured.
        That is exactly PRD-003's X8 finding, and the answer is the same one:
        a moved head is a ``fail`` whose summary says *re-run*.

        The permissiveness that remains is bounded and intentional: a proposal
        nobody posted a check to is ``skipped``, so this gate can only ever
        block a proposal that opted in by posting. Every branch below that
        point — including both except-branches — is ``fail``, because from
        there on we are holding evidence and either it is current and green or
        it is not.
