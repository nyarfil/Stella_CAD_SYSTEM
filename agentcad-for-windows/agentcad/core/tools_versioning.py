"""Tool pack: branches, immutable versions (tags) and kernel-validated merges.

Installs the two seams the feature needs and exposes them as tools:
``BranchManager`` (which registers ``ProjectStore.branch_resolver``, making
every authored-state read and write follow the calling client's branch) and
``MergeOrchestrator``. Both live on the service so route packs and the chat
agent reach the same objects. A third, smaller seam — ``install_write_guard``
— makes the store's write path branch-safe (see its docstring); it is exported
so tests can wire exactly what the pack wires.

The whole pack self-disables when git is not on PATH — no tools, no resolver,
no seams — so the product degrades to today's linear history rather than
offering an agent a tool that cannot run (the FEM-pack precedent).

Convention agents must not get backwards, repeated in every description here:
**ours = the target branch** (what you merge into), **theirs = the source**,
exactly like ``git merge <source>``.

    Two things, in this order, because the second depends on the first:

    1. ``ensure_checkout`` — the calling client's branch tree must exist. A
       tree that vanished makes the (deliberately total) read-path resolver
       fall back to the project directory, and a *write* that followed that
       fallback would land on the default branch.
    2. the turn lock, keyed by the caller's resolved working tree, so turn
       locks and undo stacks are per-branch.

    Anything that WRAPPED the previous guard is re-installed afterwards, and
    that is a correctness requirement rather than tidiness: this function
    replaces the guard rather than wrapping it, so PRD-008's per-part claim
    check (installed lazily from ``routes_presence``, because route packs
    mount after every tool pack) was silently removed by any later rebuild and
    stayed removed until the next heartbeat — a window in which one human's
    save could land straight over another's. The re-install is conditional on
    the service ALREADY having a claim registry, so a service that never had
    claims — ``checks.py``'s ephemeral one, which PRD-004 requires to end with
    ``write_guard is None`` — is left exactly as it was.
