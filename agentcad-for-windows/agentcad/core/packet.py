"""The review packet: what a proposed change actually does, as evidence.

A packet is one JSON document (``packet.json``) plus PNG and ACM assets beside
it under the proposal directory. It answers the reviewer's questions in the
order they are asked: which parts changed and how (script diff, PARAMS diff),
what that did to the numbers (metric deltas), what it did to the assembly, what
it looks like (a frame-matched before/after render pair), and how much material
was actually added or removed (kernel booleans).

**Both sides come from PRD-001's branch worktrees**, not from temp checkouts:
``branches.tree_of`` materializes a live tree per branch and ``branches.pinned``
points the store's resolver at one, which is exactly what the merge validation
pass does. Every measurement therefore runs through the *ordinary* service
methods — so the canonical, content-addressed ``.cache/`` makes every part whose
``(script, params, density, tolerance)`` tuple is unchanged free on both sides.
That is the whole cost model: the packet scales with the change, not with the
project.

**Nothing here imports OCP or build123d.** Geometry work goes to the kernel
over ``service.kernel.request`` (``geom_diff``, from ``kernel/handlers/diff.py``)
and rendering to the pure-numpy rasterizer in ``core/render.py``.

**Every per-part stage degrades on its own** (FR8): an unbuildable side yields
``build.<side>.ok: false`` with the structured script error and leaves that
side's metrics, render and geometric diff null; a boolean failure is
``geom_diff.available: false``; anything unexpected lands in ``errors`` and the
packet still returns ``ok: true``. ``ok`` is false only when no packet could be
produced at all. A red packet section is never an error response — the request
succeeded, the geometry did not.

**Head pinning** (the MVP half of FR9): the packet records both branch heads and
is served from disk while they hold. When either moves it is marked ``stale``
and regenerated on view; once the proposal merges, ``ProposalManager`` freezes
it and it is never regenerated again (FR12) — the evidence a decision was made
on has to keep saying what it said. That holds even when there was nothing to
freeze: a **terminal** proposal is never measured again, because the packet a
late viewer would get describes the merged target and whatever else has landed
since, under this proposal's name. Merging records the absence of a packet as a
frozen one that says so.

**Assets belong to a generation, not to a path.** Every build writes its diff
meshes under ``diff/<generation>/`` and its URLs carry that segment, and the
packet is published together with them: a build the merge overtook is discarded
*with its directory*, so a frozen packet's URLs keep naming the geometry it was
persisted with. A build that persists deletes the older generations under its
slot. Evidence that can be replaced behind the reader's back is not evidence.
