"""Anchor evidence at creation, anchor *status* at read time (PRD-008 FR1-FR3).

A thread's anchor is immutable: it is what the author pointed at. Where that
target is *now* is never stored — it is computed on every read, here, into one
of four states:

``ok``
    the anchor still points at what it pointed at, by identity.
``moved``
    re-matched at a different address; the result carries the new address and
    the score that earned it. The stored anchor is unchanged.
``orphaned``
    the target is gone, or no candidate cleared the tolerance. The thread stays
    readable and resolvable and keeps its last-known anchor.
``unverified``
    **we did not look.** An unbuilt part, no git, a frozen packet. This is a
    fourth fact, not a synonym for "fine": rendering it as ``ok`` is exactly how
    a UI ends up drawing a pin on a stale ordinal.

Two rules govern everything below.

**Orphan rather than guess.** A comment pointing at the wrong face is worse
than a comment pointing at nothing, so an ambiguous best match is an orphan, a
low-confidence line remap is an orphan, and a lone candidate that only *looks*
certain because it had no rival is an orphan unless it clears an absolute bar
on its own (:data:`LONE_AREA_REL`) *and* still touches the same number of faces
(:func:`_same_neighborhood`). Loosening a tolerance to make a pin appear is the
one change this module must never take.

This is a strong bias, **not a guarantee**, and the two measured classes are
both stated wherever a number is, because they are not the same number:

* **a parameter changed** — 2 mis-pins in 2 693 face pairs whose identity is
  known (0.07%);
* **a feature was deleted** — 4 mis-pins in 327 faces that no longer exist
  (1.2%), down from 27 (8.3%) before the adjacency gate below.

The second class is the one an earlier claim of "never" hid: the sweep that
produced the 2-in-2 693 figure only ever perturbs a *number*, so every face it
scores still exists somewhere and it cannot say anything about a face that was
destroyed. **A cut-away face can still re-pin.** The four that do are a square
pad on a square plate, where the normal, the normalized position, the outline
and the adjacency are all the same on both faces and only the area share
differs — by less than the gate. Confirm with ``face_info`` before acting on an
expensive decision.

**Resolution never calls the kernel and never forces a build.** Listing threads
on a 40-part project must not rebuild 40 parts. Face signatures are derived in
*this* process from the two files a build already wrote — ``<key>.acm`` and the
``<key>.faces.u32`` sidecar — with NumPy. ``agentcad.kernel.acm`` states in its
own docstring that it has no OCP dependency, and ``core/packet.py``,
``core/service.py`` and ``core/tools_vision.py`` already read it from the server
process. Nothing here imports OCP or build123d, directly or transitively.

Two traps this module encodes:

* **``n_faces`` has two definitions, and only one of them defines an ordinal.**
  ``metrics["n_faces"]`` is ``len(shape.faces())``, which build123d
  deduplicates by hash; the ``.faces.u32`` sidecar comes from the raw
  ``TopExp_Explorer`` walk that ``mesh.py`` tessellates in, and does not. The
  design warns the metric can therefore be *smaller* on a compound or a
  shared-face shape — **we could not reproduce that**: the two agreed on all 14
  shapes measured, including a compound of two coincident boxes (changelog
  0113). Face indices are still validated against ``max(sidecar) + 1`` —
  :func:`sidecar_face_count` — because the sidecar is what an ordinal *is*, not
  because the metric was caught disagreeing.
* **A mesh-derived signature is not the B-rep.** Measured against ``face_info``
  on a cylinder: on a *planar* face the normal and centroid agree to 1e-6 and
  the tessellated area is 0.5% low (chord error, always low, never high). On
  the *closed curved* side face the areas still agree to 0.13% — and the
  normals do not agree at all, because an area-weighted normal over a surface
  that wraps a full turn very nearly cancels, while ``face_info`` reports a
  single ``normal_at(0.5, 0.5)`` sample. No tolerance reconciles those two.
  It is survivable because the matcher only ever compares a mesh-derived
  signature against another mesh-derived signature at the same
  ``MESH_TOLERANCE``: a consistent estimator beats an accurate one. On such
  faces the estimator is merely *wobbly*, which costs candidacy and yields an
  orphan rather than a wrong pin. The payload labels these numbers as
  mesh-derived for the same reason, and ``face_info`` remains the tool for
  inspecting one face exactly.
* **A ``proposal_hunk`` anchor reads the persisted ``packet.json``, and only
  that.** ``service.packets.packet(...)`` regenerates a stale packet — which
  rebuilds geometry on both sides of the proposal and can move the proposal's
  own state — so validating or reading one comment would rewrite the evidence
  it comments on. :func:`stored_packet` is the one door, and a packet that is
  absent, frozen or unreadable is answered as a *state*, never built.

# --------------------------------------------------------------- tolerances
#
# MEASURED, not guessed (risk R1's spike; every number is in
# docs/changelog/0113-prd008-anchor-resolution.md). The FIRST run, whose
# outcome numbers were superseded by the re-measurement further down — its
# method and its two findings still stand. 11 bundled parts across
# construction/fasteners/prototyping/rocketry x every numeric parameter x
# +1%/+10%/+30% = 91 rebuild pairs and 3 206 face pairs, ground truth
# established independently of this matcher: a chain of <=2% parameter steps,
# each step matched by mutual-nearest-neighbour on ABSOLUTE centroids (reliable
# at that step size, and using none of the features below), composed.
#
# Two findings set these values, and both contradict the design's guesses:
#
# 1. A face ordinal is NOT stable across a parameter change. 90.5% of faces
#    kept their ordinal, but prototyping/enclosure_lid renumbered 20 of its 44
#    faces for a 1% change. The matcher is load-bearing, not a fallback.
# 2. Filtering candidates by area MAKES the matcher mis-pin. Every rival a
#    filter removes is a rival that would have tripped the ambiguity check, so
#    the design's `AREA_REL` filter turned orphans into wrong answers: at the
#    design's five constants the sweep produced 63 mis-pins on faces whose
#    identity is known, plus 42 matches to faces that no longer existed. Area
#    is therefore a *final gate on the winner*, never a candidacy filter, and
#    the ambiguity margin does the safety work.
#
# RE-MEASURED after code review (changelog 0123), because the first run's
# "ZERO mis-pins" did not survive a stricter ground-truth oracle and did not
# cover the case the review reproduced. Same method, two changes: the whole
# <=2% chain is retained so truth can be recomputed offline, and each MNN hop
# now needs a *Lowe ratio test* in both directions (nearest at least 2x nearer
# than the runner-up) — without it, plain MNN pairs a face with the wrong
# near-twin on a repeated-feature part and 16 composed hops turn that into
# confident wrong truth. An ambiguous hop drops the face from the sample rather
# than guessing, so the oracle costs sample size, never correctness. 30 chains
# (4 example projects, 11 parts, up to 3 parameters each), 3 102 face pairs at
# the checkpoints, 2 693 of them with a truth mapping.
#
# At the values below, with both lone-candidate gates (the per-ratio lines are
# the gated ones; an earlier version of this block quoted the *ungated* split,
# which is why its three numbers summed to 1 481 and its total said 1 451):
#
#   +1%   540/949  (56.9%) resolved, 407 orphaned, 2 mis-pinned
#   +10%  486/879  (55.3%) resolved, 393 orphaned, 0 mis-pinned
#   +30%  425/865  (49.1%) resolved, 440 orphaned, 0 mis-pinned
#   all  1 451/2 693 (53.9%) resolved, 1 240 orphaned, 2 mis-pinned
#
# plus 409 faces with no truth mapping, of which 146 orphaned and 263 matched
# something (the oracle drops faces it cannot pair unambiguously, so most of
# those still exist and were most likely matched correctly).
#
# **TWO MIS-PINS REMAIN, and they are not advertised away.** Both are
# rocketry/nozzle at +1% on `chamber_d`: a body of revolution whose seam faces
# the oracle pairs one way and the matcher another, at dot ~1.0 and area error
# ~0.01. One has three candidates and clears the ambiguity margin; one is
# lone and clears the area gate. Neither is reachable by tightening a
# tolerance that would not also orphan hundreds of true pairs, and we cannot
# tell from the data alone which of the two answers is right.
#
# MEASURED SEPARATELY, and this is the class the sweep above CANNOT SEE: what
# happens when a feature is DELETED (changelog 0125). The sweep only ever moves
# a number, so every face it scores still exists; the case the review and the
# verification round both reproduced is a face that no longer exists at all,
# with something else sitting where it was. 67 deletions — a plate+feature
# family (boss, pad, rib, hole, pocket, counterbore) swept over the sizes that
# make the deleted face look most like the one under it, plus 13 real deletions
# in the bundled examples (a hole group, an igniter boss, a footprint recess, a
# bore chamfer, an inner fillet, countersunk screw holes) — and ground truth
# from a geometric oracle that uses none of the matcher's features: every
# triangle centroid of a BEFORE face is tested against the AFTER mesh with an
# exact point-to-triangle distance, so "destroyed" means no part of the face is
# on the new boundary and the only correct answer is `orphaned`.
#
#   327 destroyed faces   300 orphaned (91.7%), 27 MIS-PINNED   before
#                         323 orphaned (98.8%),  4 MIS-PINNED   after
#   515 surviving faces   375 resolved (72.8%), 0 mis-pinned, unchanged by the
#                         gate that closed the 23
#
# The gate is :func:`_same_neighborhood` and it costs NOTHING on the parameter
# class: all 1 144 correct lone matches there keep their neighbor count, so
# the numbers above are the same with it and without it. The four survivors are
# a square pad on a square plate — same normal, same normalized position, same
# outline, same adjacency, area share 0.13 apart — and there is nothing left in
# a mesh-derived signature to separate those. So the contract this module
# states is "orphan rather than guess; mis-pins are rare (2 in 2 693 across a
# parameter change, 4 in 327 when a feature is deleted) rather than
# impossible", and every surface says both numbers or a bound covering both
# (AGENTS.md, tools_comments._FACE_ODDS, docs/agent-api.md,
# docs/architecture.md, docs/user-guide.md, the PRD's AC2 divergence).
#
# Two candidates that did NOT earn their place, on the same data:
#   * circularity (4*pi*A/P^2, a dimensionless outline descriptor): caught 16
#     of the 27 deletion mis-pins on its own, added ZERO on top of adjacency,
#     and cost 28 resolutions on the parameter class at its best bar (0.2).
#     Not shipped — a feature that only duplicates another one's catches is
#     dead weight that looks like a safety net.
#   * the adjacency gate applied to every winner instead of only to a lone one:
#     identical on the deletion class, and it orphans 4 true matches on
#     injector_plate.n_orifices, where the parameter itself changes the
#     topology. Gates go on a lone winner, never on candidacy.
#
# Loosening any of these to make a pin appear is still the one change this
# module must never take.

# True pairs went as low as dot 0.9724 (a rotating face under a 30% angle
# change); rivals below this are a different surface. Kept deliberately loose:
# a true face filtered OUT of the pool is a face that cannot trip the ambiguity
# check, which is how a lone rival becomes a mis-pin.
NORMAL_DOT = 0.99
# The normalized-bbox centroid moved at most 0.1615 for a true pair (p99
# 0.1528 at +30%). Candidacy radius, generous on purpose for the same reason.
UVW_DIST = 0.15
# Best-minus-runner-up. The design guessed 0.05, which mis-pinned 60 faces;
# 0.15 still mis-pinned one; 0.20 was the best of them. This constant is what
# the orphan-rather-than-guess bias rests on WHEN THERE IS A RIVAL — see
# LONE_AREA_REL for the case where there is not, which is the case it cannot
# reach and where the review found a mis-pin.
AMBIGUITY_MARGIN = 0.20
# A FINAL GATE on the winner, not a filter: a face whose share of the shape's
# tessellated area differs by more than this is refused even when it is the
# only candidate (measured: two such matches in the run, one of them a 1 000x
# jump, both on faces that no longer existed). It compares the *fraction* of
# total area, not mm^2, for the same reason ``bbox_uvw`` exists: a parameter
# that scales the part multiplies every absolute area and moves no fraction.
AREA_REL = 0.5
# The same gate, tightened, for a candidate that is ALONE in the pool.
#
# This is the review's finding, and it is the hole the paragraph above did not
# see: ``AMBIGUITY_MARGIN`` is what "orphan, never mis-pin" actually rests on,
# and it cannot fire when there is nothing to compare the winner against. A
# lone survivor was therefore accepted for being the only one left, at a
# reported margin of ``best - 0`` — near-maximal confidence for evidence that
# was never corroborated. The reproduction: a boss widened until its top face
# has the same normal and the same normalized position as the plate top
# underneath it, then cut away; the thread moved onto the plate at 0.87, with
# an area share off by 0.43 — inside the 0.5 gate.
#
# 0.30 is measured, on the re-run described at the top of this block. Over the
# 1 174 lone-candidate matches whose truth is known, area-share error runs
# median 0.025, p90 0.194, p95 0.218, p99 0.322, max 0.432; 0.30 therefore
# keeps ~98% of them, refuses the 0.434 mis-pin, and costs 1.1 points of
# overall resolution (55.0% -> 53.9%). **The headroom is thin and it is stated
# rather than hidden**: AC2's own fixture — widening a plate under an unchanged
# boss — is a *true* pair at 0.2739, because ``area_frac`` is only invariant
# when the WHOLE shape scales, and a change to one feature moves every other
# face's share. Anything below 0.28 orphans that pin.
#
# A *score* bar cannot do this job. Correct lone matches score down to 0.7407
# (p1 0.85) and the mis-pin scored 0.8697, so a score bar that caught it would
# orphan a fifth of the true ones.
#
# **AND IT IS NOT ENOUGH BY ITSELF, which is what the verification round
# showed.** Widen the same boss a little further — r=20 on a 40 mm plate — and
# the plate top left behind is 0.237 away in area share, INSIDE this bar, and
# the thread moved onto it at confidence 0.9289 (also at r=20/h=2, r=19.5/h=1,
# r=20/h=4). **Tightening this bar is not the answer, measured**: on the
# deletion sweep, alone, it mis-pins 27 of 327 at 0.30, 21 at 0.20 and still 14
# at 0.10 — while 0.20 costs 84 of the parameter class's 1 451 resolutions and
# 6 of the deletion class's 375 surviving faces. The area share is the last
# *metric* feature, and every metric feature is one the replacement face
# reproduces by construction — same surface, same place. It takes a non-metric
# one: see :func:`_same_neighborhood`, which is kept as a second gate rather
# than a replacement, because the two are not redundant (0.5 + adjacency
# mis-pins 7 of 327 where 0.30 + adjacency mis-pins 4).

#
# The design's fifth constant, ``STICKY_MARGIN = 0.02`` — keep the stored

    produces mis-pins. The winner must then clear the runner-up by
    :data:`AMBIGUITY_MARGIN` and survive the area gate.

    **A lone candidate is the case that has no ambiguity check at all**, and it

    normal and position. A ``margin`` reported alongside a single candidate
    means "against no rival"; it is not a confidence.

    context used to be consulted only to break a tie between two or more
    copies, so deleting the anchored occurrence of a snippet that appeared
    twice left the *other* one as "the only match", and the resolver reported
    ``moved`` at confidence 1.0 — the script-anchor twin of the lone-candidate
    face mis-pin, and refused here the same way: a lone hit has to answer to
    the stored context, or it is not a hit.

    "Corroborated" first meant **one side, not both** — a real edit around a
    moved block routinely rewrites the line after it while the lines before it
    stand — and the verification round showed that is too weak, for a reason
    the first fix had backwards. Duplicated blocks in real code end the same
    way (``    return shell``) far more often than they begin the same way, so
    the surviving twin of a deleted block coincides on one side *routinely*,
    and one agreeing side was enough to pin it at confidence 1.0 while the
    other side flatly contradicted. A side that disagrees is evidence, not a
    missing vote.

    So: a lone hit must be contradicted by **nothing**. A side that stored no
    context — the top or the bottom of a file, or an anchor written before
    context existed — is not checked, because there is nothing in it to check;
    such an anchor keeps the old behavior and is the one shape this gate cannot
    speak about. **With rivals the rule is unchanged**: context is a tie-break,
    because there the ambiguity itself already stops a wrong unique answer.

    Refusing here is not the end of the line, and that is what makes the strict
    rule cheap: :func:`_resolve_script_range` falls through to the tier-2 line
    map against the blob at the anchor's own head. A block that stayed in its
    neighborhood with one side rewritten is precisely the case a diff answers
    correctly; a block that moved across the file keeps neither side and was

    The header is the identity and the index is not: a regeneration renumbers
    hunks freely, so a re-map is a byte-identical ``header`` match *within the
    new generation*, unique or nothing. Three deliberate choices:

    * **A frozen packet is ``unverified``, whatever its generation says.** The
      diff it describes is history the moment a merge lands, and this thread is
      the record of a review of exactly that; answering ``ok`` would invite a
      UI to open a live diff that no longer exists.
    * **A new generation is ``moved``, even to the same index.** A generation
      is one measurement; a different one measured different commits, so
      claiming the reviewed text is unchanged would be a claim nobody checked.
    * **Two matching headers orphan.** Same rule as the face matcher:
      ambiguity is an orphan, never a guess.

    Decision 7's cross-branch rule does not apply here — a proposal is
    branch-free storage that *names* its two branches, so it is equally
    readable from either one.
