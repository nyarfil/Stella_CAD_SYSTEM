"""Tool pack: navigation at scale — part metadata, search, bulk ops (PRD-027).

**Load order.** Tool packs are discovered by `_load_tool_packs` in
``pkgutil.iter_modules`` order, which is alphabetical: this module sorts at
``nav`` — after ``tools_materials`` (so `service.materials` is already the
project-aware resolver by the time anything here reads a material) and before
``tools_packages`` / ``tools_proposals``. That last one matters and is the
``tools_run_checks`` trap in AGENTS.md restated: ``tools_proposals`` sets
``service.gate_providers = []`` unconditionally, so a gate provider registered
from here would be thrown away without a word. **This pack registers none**,
and must not grow one — a navigation concern has nothing to prove about a
package anyway.

**What it does not touch.** Organizing is not building. Nothing in this pack
calls `ensure_mesh` or `_ensure_built`, nothing enters `_cache_key`'s payload,
and `folder`/`tags` are absent from every geometry request — moving a part
between folders must never invalidate its cached mesh.

**Events.** A metadata write publishes `project_changed` (which is what the
history snapshot hook sees — one publish, one snapshot, one undo step) and
then `parts_meta_changed`, the narrow event a client uses to re-file rows
without reloading the whole project. The order is load-bearing: a client that
acts on `parts_meta_changed` must be able to assume the durable write is
already done and already snapshotted.
