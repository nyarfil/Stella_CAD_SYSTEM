"""``SpecRunner``: three evaluation tiers, one report, and the result cache.

Declaration is data (``agentcad/toolkit/specs.py``) and measurement is the
kernel's job (``agentcad/kernel/handlers/specs.py``); this module is the
orchestration between them — the review packet's discipline applied one layer
up. **It imports no geometry kernel**: every measurement is a
``service.kernel.request``, so predicates and part scripts run only in the
confined worker, never in the server process.

The three tiers (design Decision 3) and what each one costs:

===========  =========================================  =====================
tier         checks                                     when
===========  =========================================  =====================
1 — shape    valid, mass, volume, bbox, wall, that      every rebuild
2 — assembly interference_free, clearance, stackup      ``run`` only
3 — expensive fem_static                                ``run`` only
===========  =========================================  =====================

A rebuild is what an engineer does while dragging a slider, so tiers 2 and 3
are reported there as ``{"status": "skip", "reason": "deferred"}`` — visible
and named, never silent.

Four rules this file is written around:

* **Zero added work for a part that declares nothing.** :func:`declares_specs`
  is an ``ast.parse`` presence scan, memoized by content hash; a spec-less part
  reaches no kernel call at all, and :meth:`SpecRunner.tier1` returns ``None``
  ("none declared", which is not "not evaluated").
* **The cache key already covers specs.** ``SPECS`` lives in the script text,
  which is what ``service._cache_key_for`` hashes, so
  ``.cache/<cache_key>.specs.json`` sits beside ``.metrics.json`` and is
  invalidated for free. A corrupt sidecar is discarded and recomputed, never
  raised (the ``metrics.json`` precedent). **A failed evaluation is cached
  too** — see :meth:`SpecRunner._shape_tier`: the same script and params
  produce the same ``contract_error``, and the UI re-reads a part on every
  ``rebuild_finished``, so caching only the successes made every read pay a
  fresh ``spec_eval``. ``run_specs`` is the one surface that ignores a cached
  failure.
* **The report degrades, it never raises.** A failing check, a broken
  predicate, an unknown instance id, a ``specs.py`` that will not execute and a
  ``KernelError`` mid-measurement are all *payload*. The only things that raise
  are the ordinary argument errors: ``NotFoundError`` for an unknown
  project/part/branch, ``ValidationError`` for a ref that is not a branch or a
  ref on a project with no git.
* **``service.branches`` is read inside the methods, never in ``__init__``** —
  the tool pack that constructs the runner sorts before the versioning pack, so
  the seam does not exist yet at construction time.
* **The proposal gate is fail-closed** (:meth:`SpecRunner.gate_provider`). A
  declared check that failed, errored, was never evaluated, or was *skipped for
  any reason at all* is RED, and ``allow_invalid`` does not waive it. It never
  returns ``pending`` either — PRD-002's ``merge()`` blocks only a ``fail``, so
  a source head that moved mid-evaluation is a ``fail`` that says to retry.
  That is the deliberate divergence from PRD-002's default — where a provider
  outage degrades to ``pending`` — and it is the divergence PRD-002's as-built
  note reserved for this PRD.

        cached failure and measures again.

        "checked_at", "summary", "failures", "skips", "errors", "reason"}``.

        ``available`` says whether a verdict for ``head`` was produced:
        ``False`` only for ``pending``, where the head moved out from under the
        measurement and the honest answer is "ask again", not a verdict wearing
        a commit it did not measure. The head is read **before and after**, as
        the review packet does one layer up — both times for the branch
        :meth:`_verdict_branch` resolved, which for ``ref=None`` is the
        caller's own.

        Bounded three ways, in order of how much they save: the shared
        canonical ``.cache/`` (an unchanged part is a disk read on both sides
        of a branch), the per-head memo below, and :data:`GATE_BUDGET_S` —
        whose exhaustion is *red*, with ``reason == "budget_exceeded"`` and a
        summary naming ``run_specs``, because a spec that was not measured is
        not evidence of green.

        The memo key is ``(project, branch, head)``. The design named
        ``(project, source_head, declaration_hash)``; for a branch the head
        **is** the declaration hash — PRD-001 snapshots every write, so an
        edited ``SPECS`` moves it — and computing a separate one would mean
        materializing the ref's tree first, which is exactly the work the memo
        exists to skip. Nothing is memoized without a head (no git, no key),
        without a branch we can name, or for a ``pending`` result.

        A **budget_exceeded verdict IS memoized**, deliberately: it is red with
        a stable reason for that head, and re-paying an exhausted 30 s budget
        on every ``proposal_get`` is the outcome the memo exists to prevent.
        The gate therefore stays red-with-the-budget-reason until the head
        moves or ``run_specs`` — unbounded, and named in the summary — warms
        the sidecars and drops the verdict (:meth:`_forget_budget_verdicts`).

        gate, not two), and its own except-branch names a gate after the
        provider function, so even a bug in here cannot produce a differently
        named gate.

        It is evaluated against the proposal's **source branch**, not a merge
        preview: "will the merged result be green" needs a staged merge tree
        that does not exist yet and is PRD-004's question, while "is the
        proposed state green" is the one a reviewer actually asks.

        State mapping (PRD-003 owns these):

        ==========  =====================================================
        ``skipped`` the source ref declares no specs at all
        ``pass``    everything declared was measured; nothing failed, errored
                    or was skipped
        ``fail``    anything failed, errored, was skipped, or could not be
                    evaluated — including a kernel error, a source branch that
                    will not build, a ``specs.py`` that will not declare, an

        ==========  =====================================================

        ``pending`` is deliberately **not** in that table. PRD-002's ``merge()``
        blocks a ``fail`` and nothing else, so every state this provider can
        return that is not a measured green has to be ``fail`` — a ``pending``
        specs gate would have merged content no verdict ever measured.

        PRD-002 refuses a merge on any ``fail`` and ``allow_invalid`` cannot
        waive a provider gate — it is the caller's statement about the
        *kernel's* verdict on geometry and must not come to mean two things.
        A declared-but-unmeasured spec is therefore a hard block whose only
