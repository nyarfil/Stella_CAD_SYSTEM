"""Tool pack: 1-D tolerance stack-up analysis along an assembly mate chain.

``tolerance_stackup`` walks the unique path between two instances through the
mate forest (each instance's mate is an edge to its anchor; roots have none):
up from ``from_instance`` to the lowest common ancestor, then down to
``to_instance``, endpoints included. Every instance on that path contributes
its part's linear PMI dims (set via ``set_part_pmi``) whose target matches the
requested world axis — x -> "width", y -> "depth", z -> "height". Totals are
accumulated two ways: worst case (linear sum of plus and of minus) and RSS
(root sum of squares over the individual dims). The nominal distance between
the endpoints comes from the mate-resolved assembly transforms.

A path instance bound to a configuration (PRD-012) gets a warning of its own:
its tolerances are the part's, while its nominal is that configuration's, and
per-configuration PMI is a stated non-goal.
