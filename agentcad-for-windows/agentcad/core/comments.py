"""Anchored review threads: the durable document, its lifecycle and audit.

A thread is a root comment plus ordered replies, pinned to something in the
model — a part, a face, a parameter, a script line range, an assembly instance
or a proposal diff hunk — with state ``open``/``resolved`` (PRD-008 FR4). This
module is the whole of that workflow and nothing else: it writes files and
validates anchors, and it never builds, renders or touches git.

**Where the state lives.** ``<project>/.history/agentcad/comments/``, beside
PRD-002's ``proposals/`` and PRD-001's ``config.json``/``checkouts.json``, and
therefore inside GIT_DIR. Three consequences, all deliberate: ``git add -A``
can never stage a thread (discussion is not model state), ``project_restore``
— which is ``git checkout <commit> -- .`` in a *working tree* — structurally
cannot rewind one (AC8 is true by construction, not by an exclude line someone
must keep correct), and every branch sees the same list, because a comment on
a face must be visible from wherever you are working and belong to no branch.
Paths always come from ``store.canonical_path_of`` — never ``path_of``, which
follows the caller's branch.

```
.history/agentcad/comments/
  next_id             "8\\n"     the id high-water mark (NOT a cache)
  index.json          {"next_id": 8, "threads": [summary, …]}   (a CACHE)
  notifications.jsonl mention + read lines, append-only, one log per project
  7/thread.json · 7/audit.jsonl
```

**Durability rules — PRD-002's, copied rather than reinvented.**
``thread.json``/``index.json``/``next_id`` are ``ProjectStore._atomic_write``;
``audit.jsonl`` is *appended* and never rewritten (a read-modify-replace cycle
loses append-only-ness and can truncate the log on a crash), and there is
deliberately no method here that edits or removes a line. ``index.json`` is
rebuilt from the per-thread directories whenever it is missing or unparseable,
so it is never the source of truth; ids are decimal strings from ``next_id``,
which only increments, so a directory deleted by hand cannot hand its id to
the next thread.

**The anchor is immutable.** It is written once, at creation, and never
updated: a stored anchor is evidence of what the author pointed at, and
evidence that rewrites itself is not evidence. Where that target is *now* is
computed at read time by ``core/anchors.py`` (PRD-008 slice 2) into four
states — ``ok``/``moved``/``orphaned``/``unverified`` — and nothing in this
module stores a status.

**Attribution.** The actor is ``locks.current_client_id()`` — the identity
turn locks and branch checkouts already key on — and :func:`actor_kind` is
imported from ``proposals.py``, never re-implemented. That is bookkeeping, not
authentication (the header is unvalidated until PRD-005): editing and deleting
are restricted to a comment's own author as an honesty check, and anyone may
resolve or reopen anything, because there is no authentication to base a rule
on. The audit says who did.

``face``, ``script_range`` and ``proposal_hunk`` anchors are validated by
``core/anchors.py``, which also annotates every *view* — never the document —
with a ``resolution`` block. A ``proposal_hunk`` anchor reads PRD-002's
**persisted** ``packet.json`` and never ``service.packets.packet(...)``, which
rebuilds geometry and can move a proposal's state.

**Mentions.** ``@<identity>`` in a body notifies that identity — but only when
it names a *plausible* one (``browser``, ``browser:<nonce>``, ``chat``,
``chat:<session>``, or a client the presence registry currently knows).
``@todo`` stays prose. Deliveries are appended to a single per-project
``notifications.jsonl`` with a ``to`` field, never one file per identity: an
identity is an arbitrary string from an unvalidated header, and a filename
derived from one is a path-traversal surface. ``read`` is a *line* in the same
log, so unread is derived (mentions minus every seq a later ``read`` line
names) and nothing is ever rewritten.

**Events.** Every mutation publishes exactly one ``comment_changed`` through
``service.bus.publish`` (:meth:`CommentManager._publish`), and an idempotent
no-op publishes none. It is deliberately **not** ``project_changed``: that
event's ``on_publish`` hook snapshots project history, and a comment is not a
model change. ``bus.on_publish`` itself is a single slot already owned by
``service._snapshot_on_event`` and is never assigned here. Each mention adds a
``notification`` event beside that one, published from the same seam.
