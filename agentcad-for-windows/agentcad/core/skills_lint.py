"""Skill lint (PRD-029 FR1/FR6) — pure: no service, no kernel, no build.

What ``agentcad skill lint`` runs, what the core-library test runs over every
shipped skill, and what a future marketplace gate (PRD-031) will run over a
submission. One function, two profiles, the ``materials_lint`` precedent:

``library``
    what ``agentcad/skills/`` is held to: ``license`` and ``author`` are
    required and a body over the cap is an **error** — a core skill that needs
    truncating at load is content debt, not a runtime problem.
``user``
    what a hand-written project skill is held to: those three are warnings.

Everything else is an error in both profiles, because the alternative is a
skill the loader will refuse at runtime with nobody having been told.
``unknown_key`` is a **warning** on purpose: the frontmatter format has to
stay forward-compatible, so a key from a newer version is noise, not a fault.

**Traps**

* The rules that decide whether a file is *loadable* live in
  ``core/skills.py`` (:func:`~agentcad.core.skills.parse_frontmatter` and its
  validation); this module never re-implements them, it only assigns a code,
  a level and a profile. One parser, one answer.
* A skill file is untrusted data: every read is size-capped and decoded
  strictly, and an unreadable one is a ``frontmatter`` **finding**, never an
  exception. The lint must survive a hostile directory.
* Dotfiles are never ``stray_file`` — the scaffold writes ``snippets/.keep``,
  and a ``.DS_Store`` is not a lint finding. ``README.md`` beside the skills
  is not a skill and not a stray either.
* :func:`lint_dir` lints the **directory** form of a duplicated skill and
  reports ``duplicate_skill_file`` once, matching the loader, where the
  directory wins.

# {title}

What this skill is for, in a sentence or two. Everything below is reference
material for an agent writing a part script.

## Rules of thumb

- The numbers, tolerances or ratios that matter, with their units.

## Worked example

```python
PARAMS = {{"width": {{"default": 40.0, "min": 10.0, "max": 200.0, "unit": "mm"}}}}


def build(p):
    from build123d import Box

    return Box(p.width, 20, 10)
```

Complete, runnable scripts belong in `snippets/` beside this file; data the
body refers to belongs in `tables/*.json`.

## Sources

- Where these numbers come from.
