"""Tool pack: parts packages — search, install, materialise (PRD-011).

Installs one seam, ``service.packages``
(:class:`~agentcad.core.packages.manager.PackageManager`), exposes six tools,
and attaches provenance to ``get_part`` / ``get_project`` by **wrapping** the
bound methods (``tools_specs.install_rebuild_specs`` is the precedent).

**THIS PACK REGISTERS NO GATE PROVIDER — deliberately, permanently.**
``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` **alphabetically**
and ``tools_proposals.py:51`` assigns ``service.gate_providers = []``
**unconditionally**. ``tools_packages`` sorts at ``pac``, which is *before*
``pro`` — so anything this module appended to ``gate_providers`` would be
silently discarded: no error, no warning, no gate. That is the trap that
forced ``tools_run_checks.py`` over ``tools_checks.py``, and a test in
``tests/test_packages_tools.py`` pins the prohibition.

The publish gate is not a merge gate: it gates ``publish``, a CLI action on a
*directory*, not a proposal merge. A materialised package part is an **ordinary
part**, so PRD-004's ``checks`` gate already rebuilds it, runs its specs and
re-resolves the assembly on every proposal. If a ``packages`` gate is ever
wanted (the plausible one: "every dependency in this proposal is locked and
verifies"), **the escape hatch is named so nobody rediscovers it the hard
way**: it goes in a *second* pack called ``tools_publish.py`` (``pub`` sorts
after ``pro``), or is installed lazily from ``server/routes_packages.py``,
which is the ``routes_presence`` claim-guard precedent. It never goes in this
file.

**Nothing later is captured at registration.** At ``pac``, ``service.specs``
(``s``), ``service.branches`` (``v``), ``service.proposals`` and
``service.gate_providers`` (``p``) **do not exist**. Every one of them is read
*inside* a method, behind ``getattr(service, …, None)``.

**The publish gate is a CORRECTNESS gate, not a security boundary.** A package
is Python; ``use_part`` copies it into the project and the next rebuild
executes it in the kernel worker with the user's privileges. Every description
below that installs or runs package code says so (design Decision 11, places
2, 3 and 4).
