"""The shared sketch emitter: a solved sketch -> idiomatic build123d source.

This module is the **single** emitter for both layers (PRD-009 FR9/AC1). The
GUI used to format its own snippet in `frontend/js/sketcher.js`; an agent had
nothing at all. One emitter, on the server, means the browser and an agent
produce **byte-identical** code for the same spec, and it means the golden test
can rebuild that code through the kernel instead of through a browser.

It runs in the **server** process, so — like `toolkit/sketch.py` — it must
never import build123d/OCP. Emitting build123d *source* is not importing
build123d.

## Three rules, each traceable to a measurement (design Decision 10)

1. **Shared vertex literals.** A junction where two curves meet is formatted
   **once** and referenced by both through a `v<n>` binding. A derived
   endpoint (an arc's `start`/`end`) is formatted from the **solved point**,
   never recomputed by the reader from a rounded centre/radius/angle.
2. **Nine decimals**, up from `fmtNum`'s six. Measured: a centre-parametrized
   arc chain at 6 decimals leaves a **7.58e-7 mm** gap and `make_face()`
   raises *"Face can only be created with closed wires"*; 7 decimals
   (3.7e-8 mm) is the first that closes. Nine leaves two orders of margin and
   still reads as a number a human will edit.
3. **Endpoint-anchored constructors** in a chain — `RadiusArc(start, end, r,
   short_sagitta=...)` and `ThreePointArc` over `CenterArc`. Measured:
   endpoint-anchored closes at **every** precision tested, because the arc and
   both neighbours are literally the same rounded pair.

## The closure gate

Before returning, the emitter measures every junction **from the formatted
literals** — parsed back exactly as the reader will parse them — against every
solved endpoint that literal stands in for, and against the endpoint a
centre-parametrized arc would derive. Above `CLOSURE_TOL_MM` it **refuses to
emit `make_face()`**, raising an `EmitError` naming the junction; on an open
chain, where nothing will fail to close, it reports the same measurement as a
warning. Emitting code that will not rebuild is the one failure this feature
must not produce.

That measurement is a superset of the design's "vertex-to-vertex gap": with
shared literals a chain's vertex-to-vertex gap is zero by construction, so the
honest question is how far the shared literal moved the geometry it stands
for. Both failures the design names — a 6-decimal centre-parametrized arc, and
a solution whose two chained endpoints are 1e-6 mm apart — trip it.

**What the gate cannot see is whether the call is legal**, and there are three
of those, all refused where the call is written rather than where it explodes
(review 2, C8/C9): a zero sweep (`RadiusArc(v0, v0, r)` —
`Standard_ConstructionError`), a sweep past one full turn (`CenterArc(..., 450)`
— `ValueError`), and a non-positive radius **as formatted** (nine decimals
rounds 1e-11 to `Circle(radius=0.0)`, which makes no face; a negative one
raises `gp_Circ() - radius should be positive number`).

**One `BuildLine` and one `make_face()` per chain.** `make_face()` consumes
every pending edge in its builder and makes *one* face, so a single shared
`BuildLine` rebuilt two disjoint 1x1 squares into one face of area 1 instead of
two totalling 2 (review 2, C7). A sketch where nothing closes still emits, with
a `no_closed_profile` warning: `BuildSketch` with no face raises at its own
exit, and drawing an open chain and pressing Insert is a legitimate
half-finished state.

## The entity -> build123d mapping (FR9/FR11)

| entity | emitted |
|---|---|
| line chain | `Polyline(v0, v1, ...)`, or `Line(a, b)` per segment in a mixed chain |
| arc (centre-authored, in a chain) | `RadiusArc(start, end, +-r, short_sagitta=...)` |
| arc (3-point authored) | `ThreePointArc(start, mid, end)` |
| arc sweeping exactly a full turn | `CenterArc(...)` (a `RadiusArc` cannot express it) |
| full circle | `Circle(radius=...)` under `Locations(...)` |
| full ellipse | `Ellipse(x_radius=..., y_radius=..., rotation=...)` under `Locations(...)` |
| elliptical arc | `EllipticalCenterArc(centre, a, b, start_angle=..., arc_size=..., rotation=...)` |
| spline | `Spline(p0, ..., pn)`, with `tangents=` for a pinned end |
| slot, standalone | `SlotCenterToCenter(sep, height, rotation=...)` under `Locations` |
| slot, tied to the sketch | its compiled primitives — two `Line`s, two `RadiusArc`s |

The slot row is the trap: `SlotCenterToCenter` is a BuildSketch **face** at the
origin, not a curve that can join a `BuildLine` chain, so a slot that carries
constraints of its own (or whose primitives share a junction with anything
else) emits as the primitives slice 6 already compiled.

## Round-trip persistence (FR10)

`emit(..., persist="profile")` wraps the code in a **structured block in the
script** — the `push_pull` precedent (`core/tools_facemod.PUSH_PULL_MARKER`),
not a sidecar file, because the PRD's non-goals say the part script is the
only artifact and a script-resident block gets branching, restore, undo, merge
and the proposal diff for free:

    # --- agentcad sketch "profile" (auto-generated; edit or remove freely) ---
    # agentcad-sketch-spec: {"v": 2, "entities": {...}, "constraints": [...],
    #                        "initial": {...}}
    # agentcad-sketch-hash: sha256:...
    def sketch_profile():
        ...
    # --- end agentcad sketch "profile" ---

`parse_blocks(script)` reads them back. **The code is the source of truth for
geometry; the spec block is provenance**, so a hash mismatch is reported
(`diverged`) and never repaired: the sketcher opens read-only and asks. A
block whose spec will not parse — or will not parse *into the shape of a
sketch spec* — is `unverified`, "we cannot tell", which is never rendered as
"there is no sketch" (the PRD-008 rule).

**The hash covers the spec line and the code together**, and the block records
an `initial` taken from the solution. Covering only the code meant `ok` said
"nobody edited the geometry" while every reader took it to mean "this spec
produced this code" — editing one coordinate in the comment left the block
`ok` — and dropping `initial` meant a sketch emitted on the branch a seed
selected reopened on the *other* branch, also `ok` (review 2, C11). That is why
the format is version 2: a version-1 block's hash covers something else, so it
reads `unverified` rather than `diverged`.

    1. `start_angle`/`arc_size` are the **eccentric anomaly**, the same
       parameter the solver uses (agreement 8.9e-16 mm), so no conversion.
    2. `arc_size` — **not** `end_angle`. Passing `end_angle` raises
       `UnboundLocalError` in 0.11.1: its deprecation branch reads a
       `direction` that is only bound when `angular_direction` is also passed.
       The working spelling is the signed sweep, which is what the solver
       reports anyway.
    3. There is **no endpoint-anchored elliptical constructor** (`RadiusArc`'s
       counterpart does not exist; `EllipticalStartArc` anchors one end and
       derives the other). So unlike an arc, an elliptical arc's endpoints are
       always *derived by the reader* from the rounded centre, axes, rotation
       and angles — which is why `_gap` measures that derivation for every
       elliptical arc regardless of `arc_anchor`.

    The call is written in the arc's own direction whichever way the chain
    walks it: build123d joins a `BuildLine` on proximity, not on order.
