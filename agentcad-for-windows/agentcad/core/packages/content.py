"""The content id: a canonical file-tree digest, plus the size ceilings.

FR2 asks for "the sha256 of its canonical archive". There is no archive — a
package is a directory (design Decision 1) — and hashing one would have been
the wrong number anyway: **tar is not byte-stable across producers** (member
ordering, mtimes, uid/gid, format), the same property that forced PRD-004's
determinism stage to compare SVG and never DXF. So identity is computed from
the *content listing*::

    content_id = "sha256:" + sha256(
        "".join(f"{posix_relpath}\\0{sha256_hex(file_bytes)}\\n"
                for path in sorted(files))
    )

No mtimes, no modes, no uids, no directory-walk order. The same number falls
out of a directory, a git checkout of that directory and a copy of it in the
cache — which is the property that makes "verify from cache" mean something.

Each entry binds a path to *its own* hash: a digest over the sorted hashes
alone would call two packages with swapped file contents identical.

Symlinks are refused outright rather than followed or recorded. A followed
link makes the listing depend on something outside the tree, a recorded one
would need a fourth field, and either way two paths for one file make the id
a function of how the tree was built.

The ceilings — 50 MB per package, 5 MB per file, 500 files — are part of the
published format. They bound a registry's disk and a malicious index's ability
to fill it, and (the load-bearing reason) they make it affordable to re-verify
the *whole* tree on every materialisation instead of trusting a receipt.
