"""The publish gate: nine stages over a package directory, measuring nothing
new.

`agentcad package validate` and (slice 8) `agentcad publish` are this module.
Every stage is a call into a surface that already exists and is reviewed — the
slice-1 validators, the kernel's `inspect` and `connectors` handlers, the
service's `set_params`/`_rebuild`, PRD-003's `SpecRunner` and the server-side
renderer — so this file *orders* measurements and turns them into rows. It
computes no geometry, and it holds no vocabulary of its own: rows are
PRD-004's `items`, statuses its four, stage and report statuses its three, and
`make_item` / `make_stage` / `finalize_report` / `exit_code` are imported from
`core/checks.py` rather than restated.

**The gate is a CORRECTNESS gate, not a security boundary.** It proves that
geometry builds, that specs pass and that connectors mate. It proves nothing
about intent: a package is Python, and `use_part` copies it into the project
where the next rebuild executes it in the kernel worker with the user's
privileges. :data:`SECURITY_NOTE` is that sentence, it is a top-level field of
every report so it travels with every copy of the evidence, and PRD-006 is the
deferred backstop (design Decision 11).

Containment (design Decision 9c), which is the part of this feature that could
damage a user:

* A run materialises into ``<work-dir>/agentcad-package-<pid>-<rand>/``, made
  with ``mkdtemp``, and **deletes only that**. A caller's ``--work-dir`` is
  left exactly as it was, and one that is, holds or sits inside the projects
  root **or the package source directory** is refused with both paths named.
* The stages drive a **second, ephemeral** :class:`AgentCADService` rooted in
  that cell, sharing the warm kernel. Its three seams are nulled —
  `bus.on_publish`, `store.branch_resolver`, `store.write_guard` — and unlike
  PRD-004's runner **this one really writes**: a run adds one part per
  variant, sets parameters, sets an assembly and renders, dozens of guarded
  store writes, so the write guard is live here and nulling it is
  load-bearing rather than prophylactic (`checks._ephemeral_service` predicted
  exactly this).
* **No user project is ever opened**, which is a structural claim and not a
  careful one: the gate creates its own project inside the cell and never
  learns the name of another.

The gate's claim about a package, stated once: *every part builds at each
parameter's own declared range and at every configuration the package ships,
its specs hold there, and every connector it declares resolves.* Never "every
combination" — see :func:`variants`.

The report is a PRD-004 document with three additions — `package`, `note` and
the verdict (`publishable` / `exempt_skips` / `blockers`). Its stage names are
not `checks.ALL_STAGES`, so :func:`validate_gate_report` is
`checks.validate_report` **minus exactly that vocabulary difference** and plus
the gate's own keys; see its docstring.

    A gate report **is** a PRD-004 report — same `schema`, same rows, same

    :data:`GATE_STAGES` is not `checks.ALL_STAGES`. `checks.validate_report`
    is the schema and may not be edited (it belongs to PRD-004), so this
    function runs it and subtracts **exactly** the unknown-stage-name problems
    it raises for names this module does declare, then applies the gate's own
    stage-name rule and checks the three additional keys.

    **The subtraction is by exact message, and that coupling is deliberate

    `checks.validate_report`'s unknown-stage-name problem **character for
    character**, including the `', '.join(checks.ALL_STAGES)` tail. If PRD-004
    rewords that message, nothing is silently dropped — the subtraction simply
    stops matching and every gate report starts failing validation, which
    would take `publish` down with it. That is loud by design (a pattern match
    would have *quietly* let an unknown stage through), and it is contained by
    `test_the_report_is_a_prd004_report_apart_from_its_stage_names`, which

    suite before it can go red in a publisher. **If you are editing
    `checks.validate_report`'s message: this function and that test are the
    two places to update, and the test will tell you.**

    Duplicate stage names are a problem in their own right: a report carrying

        This is the fix for a TOCTOU the gate used to have wide open: the id
        was hashed once at the start and every stage then read the tree
        *live*, so a file swapped in after the hash and swapped back before
        the closing re-hash was measured by the stages and invisible to both
        endpoint comparisons (`_refuse_a_moving_target` compares endpoints, not
        the interval). The published id then belonged to bytes no stage read.

        Copying first and hashing the copy closes it structurally rather than
        carefully: **the id is the id of the bytes the stages consumed**,
        because there is only one tree they can consume and nothing outside
        this process can reach it. The cell is already private, already
        `mkdtemp`-made, already deleted afterwards, and already proven not to
        overlap the package directory, so the snapshot costs one copy of a
        tree the inventory has just read anyway.

        The copy is skipped when the tree breaks the published ceilings: those
        are already a red `format` row, and copying up to a hostile amount of
        data to report a size problem would be the wrong trade. In that one
        case the stages read the origin, exactly as they used to — and the
        report is red either way.

        Both read failures are recorded rather than raised: the `format` stage
        is where they become rows, and `contract` still has to be able to say
