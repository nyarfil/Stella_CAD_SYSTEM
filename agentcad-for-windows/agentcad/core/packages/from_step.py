"""`package_from_step` — wrap a vendor STEP as a reference-part package (FR13).

The McMaster path. A supplier hands you a STEP file; this scaffolds the
directory a publish gate can measure and an index can carry: the file under
``imports/``, a ``reference`` part entry pointing at it, a ``package.json``
whose ``provenance.vendor`` records where it came from and — the mechanical
part — ``redistributable: false``, a ``docs/README.md`` stub naming the vendor
and the terms, and a rendered preview.

**What it does not do: infer connectors.** It reports the imported solid's
planar and cylindrical faces as *candidates* (through the kernel's
``reference_faces`` handler) and the author — human or agent — writes the
``connectors`` function. Deciding which cylinder is "the shaft" from an
unlabelled vendor solid is a research problem, not a slice; the design spec
records it as divergence 7 and PRD-032 is where it belongs.

**Licensing.** ``redistributable: false`` is not a label: ``LocalIndex.
publish`` refuses such a package into an index whose ``scope`` is ``public``
(slice 8), which is the mechanism behind FR13's confinement. Vendor-derived
geometry stays in personal and organisation indexes, and legal review precedes
any public seeding. The generated README says so, in the package, where the
person who publishes it will read it.

**The gate is a correctness gate, not a security boundary** — a STEP is data
rather than code, but the package it lands in is still installed and executed
by the ordinary package machinery, so the non-claim travels here too.

Containment: the scaffold writes into the destination directory and into one
throwaway cell (:func:`gate._ephemeral_service`'s rule, reused rather than
re-derived) and nowhere else. It never opens a user project.

# {name}

{summary}

**Vendor part.** This package wraps geometry supplied by **{vendor}**{part_no}.
{url_line}It is an *imported solid*, not a parametric script: it has no PARAMS,
no `build(p)` and no `connectors(p, part)`, and the publish gate measures it by
building the shipped file once.

## Licensing — read before publishing

Terms: {terms}

`provenance.vendor.redistributable` is **false** in `package.json`, and that is
mechanical rather than decorative: publishing this package into an index whose
scope is `public` is refused. Vendor-derived geometry belongs in a personal or
organisation index, and legal review precedes any public seeding of it.

## Connectors

This package declares no connectors, because a reference part cannot: a
`connectors(p, part)` function lives in a script. `package_from_step` reported
the candidates below from the imported solid's own B-rep faces — they are
*suggestions*, and nothing infers which one is a mounting face or a shaft.

{candidates}

To give this part connectors, author a script part that imports or rebuilds the
geometry and declares them, and publish that.

## Provenance

- Source file: `{source}`
- Content: {n_solids} solid(s), {volume} mm³, bounding box {bbox}

The publish gate is a CORRECTNESS gate, not a security boundary: it proves that
the geometry loads and measures, and nothing about intent. See
`docs/packages.md`.
