"""Index clients: one shape, three kinds — and the publisher.

An index is a **directory** holding `index.json` and one directory per
published package version. That is the whole format, and it is why a git repo
is an index: clone it and you have a local one. So :class:`GitIndex` is
*a local index plus a fetch step*, and a cloud index (PRD-005-lite) is the
same client over a different fetch — one implementation of parsing,
validating, searching and fetching, and the git-ness is one class.

**Writing** lives here too, because the index format is this module's:
`LocalIndex.publish` is fail-closed (a gate report that is `publishable`, a
tree that still hashes to what the gate measured, a redistributable vendor, a
version that does not already exist), `LocalIndex.yank` withdraws a version
without deleting a byte, and the module-level :func:`publish` runs the gate
over **every** stage first — it takes no stage subset precisely so a
`skip / not_selected` can never reach the verdict.

The protocol::

    name: str
    kind: str            # "local" | "git" | "cloud"
    scope: str           # "public" | "private"
    refresh() -> None                     # no-op for local
    entries() -> dict                     # the parsed, validated index.json
    fetch(name, version) -> Path          # a directory
    source_of(entry) -> dict              # what the lockfile records

`source_of` exists because a lock entry may hold **only content-determined
values**: a local index records its *index-relative* path, never the absolute
one, or two machines would write different lock bytes for the same package.

Configuration lives in `~/.agentcad/config.json` in precedence order; the
first index that answers a name wins, and `add_package {index}` pins one. A
configuration entry that cannot be built is **skipped with a warning, never
fatal** — one broken index must not make the others unreachable.

        1. the report is a gate report, it carries **every** gate stage
           exactly once, its summary and status agree with its own rows, and
           the verdict **re-derived here** from those rows is publishable —
           otherwise a `validation_error` carrying the failing rows in
           `details.checks`, PRD-004's shape. It is re-derived and not read:
           `report["publishable"]` is a field in a document, and this method's
           whole job is to be the thing that does not take a document's word
           for it. A report whose rows said the build failed, whose own
           `verdict()` agreed, and whose `publishable` said `true` used to
           publish green; so did one with no stages at all;
        2. the tree still hashes to the id the report measured. The gate
           re-reads the package after its own stages, but *this* is the window
           nobody else closes — the report is finished and then the tree
           moves. Publishing then would attest a content id nobody measured;
        3. the vendor gate (FR13): a package whose
           `provenance.vendor.redistributable` is `false` may not enter an
           index whose scope is `public`;
        4. **immutability** (FR10): an existing `name@version` — in the
           document *or* on disk — is a `conflict_error` naming it, **even
           when the content id is identical**. A byte comparison would let a
           publisher redefine "identical" later.

        Only then are bytes written: the inventoried files into a staging
        directory and `os.replace`d into `<index>/<name>/<version>/`, then
        `index.json` rewritten atomically. A document the format validator
        would refuse rolls the tree back, so a failed publish leaves the index

    **A git index is a local index plus a fetch, and that reduction is the
    design**: `refresh()` clones on first use and afterwards fetches and hard-
    resets to the ref, and everything after that — parsing, validating,
    searching, fetching a package directory — is :class:`LocalIndex` over the
    checkout. The git-ness is this class.

    **Failure is data** (design Decision 7). An unreachable remote is a
    *warning*, not an exception: the last good checkout keeps answering,
    ``stale`` becomes true and ``stale_reason`` says why, and every search hit
    carries both. A remote that was **never** cloned is a `not_found_error`
    naming the URL, because there is nothing to answer *with*.

    ``refresh()`` fetches **once per client instance** unless forced. An index
    client is long-lived on the service, and a network fetch per keystroke in
    the Library dialog is not a search; `PackageManager.reload_indexes` mints
    new clients, and `refresh(force=True)` is the explicit re-fetch.

    ``subdir`` is where the index lives **inside** the repository, and it
    exists because this repository is the first counter-example to the class's
    own assumption. A git index used to be `<checkout>/index.json`, full stop —
    so a repo that is an index and *nothing else* worked, and every repo that
    ships an index **alongside its source** did not. AgentCAD is the second
    kind: `catalog/index.json`, with the application around it. The claim "the
    bundled catalog is byte-identically what a git index would serve" was true
    only of a repository laid out the way no real one is, which is the shape of
    a test that proves the fixture rather than the product. With
    ``subdir="catalog"`` this repo is directly usable as a git index, and
    `tests/test_packages_git_index.py` drives that layout.
