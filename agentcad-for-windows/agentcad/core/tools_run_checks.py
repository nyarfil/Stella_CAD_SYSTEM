"""Tool pack: geometry CI — one command that certifies a project (PRD-004).

Installs the one seam the feature needs — ``service.checks``
(:class:`~agentcad.core.checks.CheckRunner`) — and exposes ``run_checks``. The
handler is a thin delegation; every rule lives in ``core/checks.py`` and every
*measurement* lives in the surfaces that runner drives (``_ensure_built``,
``_resolved_instances`` + ``check_interference``, ``SpecRunner.run``, the
drawing tools). This pack adds no measurement of its own.

**Why the file is called ``tools_run_checks.py`` and never ``tools_checks.py``.**
``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks ``pkgutil.iter_modules`` **alphabetically**. A
pack at ``c`` would load *before* ``tools_proposals`` (``p``) — which assigns
``service.gate_providers = []`` **unconditionally** — so the ``checks`` gate
:func:`install_checks_gate` appends from ``register()`` would be silently
thrown away, with no error and no warning. Named after the tool it registers,
the pack sorts at
``r``: after ``tools_proposals`` (``service.proposals`` and
``service.gate_providers`` exist) and before ``tools_specs`` (``s``) and
``tools_versioning`` (``v``) — so **``service.specs`` and ``service.branches``
do not exist yet at registration time** and the runner reads them inside its
methods instead. ``tests/test_checks_api.py`` pins both halves.

**The pack does NOT self-disable without git**, unlike ``tools_proposals`` and
``tools_versioning``: a check is a property of the working tree, and only the
``ref`` argument needs history (a ``ref`` on a project without git is a
``validation_error`` naming git).

    """Append the ``checks`` gate to PRD-002's provider list.

    The whole of PRD-004's decision surface is this one ``append``: a provider
    whose closure is named ``checks`` **replaces** ``ProposalManager.gates``'
    built-in placeholder of the same name, so a posted report is read where the
    merge decision is made. Reverting the feature's effect on merges is
    deleting this call.

    Calling it from ``register()`` is only safe because of the load order the
    module docstring defends: at ``r`` this pack runs *after* ``tools_proposals``
    has assigned ``service.gate_providers = []``. From a pack at ``c`` the
    append would be silently discarded.

    ``service.gate_providers`` is **absent** when git is (``tools_proposals``
    self-disables), which is not an error here: a check still runs on a project
    with no history, there is simply no proposal to post it to.

    Idempotent by name — ``build_registry`` may run twice over one service (the
    versioning pack's ``install_write_guard`` precedent), and two providers
    named ``checks`` would evaluate the gate twice and have one silently
    overwrite the other in ``ProposalManager.gates``.

        "'fail' — which DOES block proposal_merge. In particular a report "
        "posted against a head the source branch has since moved past is a "
        "fail saying to re-run, never a soft 'pending': a merge blocks on fail "

        "commits it never measured. An unknown proposal id is a not_found "
