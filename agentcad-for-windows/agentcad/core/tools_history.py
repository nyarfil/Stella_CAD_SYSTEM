"""Tool pack: git-backed project history (undo/redo for agents and the UI).

Every persistent mutation — service methods and pack tools alike, i.e.
anything that publishes ``project_changed`` — commits a snapshot of the
project directory into a per-project git repo at ``<project>/.history``
(core/history.py, wired via ``AgentCADService._snapshot_on_event``). These
tools expose that history: ``project_history`` lists snapshots newest-first;
``project_restore`` overlays a snapshot's tracked content back onto the
project and appends a fresh "restore" commit, keeping history linear — undo
is "restore history[1]", redo is "restore the commit id you were on before
the undo".

Reentrancy: ``project_restore`` sets ``history.in_restore`` around the
checkout AND its own ``project_changed`` publish, so the service's bus hook
does not stack a second snapshot on top of the internal restore commit.
