"""ProjectHistory: git-backed per-project snapshot history (undo/redo).

Each project directory gets its own git repository whose GIT_DIR lives at
``<project>/.history`` and whose work tree is the project directory itself,
so no ``.git/`` ever appears inside a project. Every persistent mutation
(anything that publishes ``project_changed`` — see
``AgentCADService._snapshot_on_event``) commits a snapshot; ``restore``
overlays a past commit's tracked content back onto the work tree and appends
a fresh "restore" commit, so history stays strictly linear: undo is "restore
the previous entry", redo is "restore the commit id you were on before the
undo".

Only authored state is tracked — ``project.json``, ``parts/*.py``,
``imports/`` — while derived data (``.cache/``, ``exports/``) and the
history repo itself are excluded via ``.history/info/exclude``.

Restore semantics (v1, deliberate): ``git checkout <commit> -- .`` overlays
the target's tracked content but does not delete files absent from the
target. A part script added after the target commit therefore survives on
disk as an orphan — invisible, because the restored manifest no longer
references it — until it is garbage or re-adopted by a later state.

Every method takes a *working tree* path, which may be the project directory
(the default branch) or a linked git worktree under ``.history/trees/<branch>/``
created by ``core/branches.py`` — ``_locate`` finds the right GIT_DIR either
way, so snapshots, restores and undo all land on the branch whose tree they
were handed.

Authorship (PRD-008, design Decision 15): every snapshot carries a
``Client: <client id>`` TRAILER — a body line, never the subject, so every
subject-prefix contract in the tree (``"restore "`` below, the proposals
reconciler's scans, and every exact-message assertion in the suite, all of
which read ``%s``) is unaffected. Git's own author/committer stay the fixed
repo-local identity on purpose: the client id is a self-asserted header, and
rewriting a commit's author with it would dress bookkeeping up as a
cryptographic claim about who wrote the change. Reading authorship back
(:func:`author_of`) accepts ``Merged-by:`` as well, because that is the
trailer ``core/merge.py`` has written on two-parent merge commits since
PRD-001 and its exact message is pinned by that feature's tests.

Design constraints: stdlib only, subprocess git with a hard timeout, and
``snapshot`` NEVER raises into the caller — a broken or missing git must
never break a CAD save.

        ``since`` widens that to the RANGE ``since..commit`` — every commit
        reachable from ``commit`` but not from ``since``, inverted newest
        first into a single commit. It exists for one caller: undoing a
        **fast-forward merge**, where the entry's ``undo_to`` names the state
        the target branch was on and everything between it and the entry
        arrived in that one merge. Reverting only the tip there leaves the
        merge half undone. A ``since`` that is not an ancestor of ``commit``
        is ignored (the single-commit revert is the honest fallback), and a
        range that contains a merge commit is refused *before* git is asked —
        a mainline cannot be meaningful for every commit of a range at once —
        as a ``ConflictError`` with ``reason: "merge_in_range"`` naming the
        merge, in the same shape as every other refusal here.

        This is what a ``scope: "mine"`` undo does when the caller's edit is no
        longer the branch head: ``restore`` would overlay a whole past tree and
        silently take somebody else's later work with it, so a targeted revert
        is the only honest step. A two-parent commit (a merge) is reverted
        against its FIRST parent — the branch that was merged *into*, i.e. the
        one that keeps.

        Never a partial apply (FR14), **in both directions**: a conflict is
        rolled back and raised as a ``ConflictError`` carrying
        ``{commit, reason, paths, blocked_by}``, and so is a failure *after*
        the patch applied cleanly — a repository hook rejecting the commit
        leaves the inverse patch applied and staged, which is a mutated project
        behind an error saying nothing happened. A commit whose changes are
        already gone from the tree raises the same error with
        ``reason: "already_reverted"`` rather than an empty commit, and a
        range containing a merge with ``reason: "merge_in_range"``.

        **A dirty tree is refused before git is asked to start** (``reason:
        "uncommitted_changes"``, with the tracked paths). Two reasons, and the
        second is the one that bit: git itself refuses to begin a revert that
        would overwrite a local modification, so there was nothing to roll
        back — but the rollback ran anyway, and a blanket ``reset --hard``
        deleted the user's own unsaved edit (the user guide documents editing
        ``parts/<id>.py`` in an external editor, so any other client's
        ``undo {scope: "mine"}`` could reach it). And even where git *would*
        have started, rolling a failure back cannot distinguish the revert's
        changes from the ones that were already there. From a clean tree it
        can: :meth:`_rollback_revert` aborts only a sequencer that actually
        started and resets only a tree the revert actually dirtied. Untracked
        files are not "uncommitted work" here — ``reset --hard`` never removes
        them, and the next snapshot adds them.

class UndoCursor:
    """One-keystroke undo/redo over a project's linear git history.

    The git history (ProjectHistory) is the durable record; this cursor is
    the in-memory two-stack UX on top of it. Each real mutation snapshot
    pushes its commit id + label onto the undo stack (and clears redo, the
    standard semantics); ``undo`` restores the top mutation's PARENT tree,
    moving that state's id to the redo stack; ``redo`` restores it back.
    Every restore rides ProjectHistory.restore, so each step is itself a
    linear "restore" commit and the durable history never rewrites.

    Stacks are process-memory (like the chat history): after a server
    restart ``undo`` degrades to a step back through the git log — the latest
    snapshot under ``scope: "any"``, the caller's most recent one within
    ``FALLBACK_SEARCH`` commits under ``"mine"`` — and ``redo`` is empty.
    A fallback entry carries no ``undo_to`` (that fact lives only in the
    stack), so a fast-forward merge undone after a restart goes back through
    its first parent. Bounded to
    ``UNDO_LIMIT`` entries per stack, and keyed by ``store.lock_key(proj)``
    so each branch's working tree gets its own undo/redo history.

    **Authorship, not ownership (PRD-008, Decision 16).** Entries record the
    client that made the edit, and ``scope`` selects which of them a step may
    consume — but the stacks are deliberately NOT re-keyed per client. A human
    watching an agent edit and pressing Cmd+Z to take it back is this product's
    flagship loop; per-client stacks would leave that browser's stack empty.
    So ``scope="any"`` is the default and is byte-identical to the behavior
    that predates authorship, and ``scope="mine"`` is the opt-in that skips
    other clients' entries. When a ``"mine"`` step's entry is no longer the
    branch head, it becomes a ``git revert`` of exactly that commit instead of
    a whole-tree restore, which would silently take later work with it.

        is the whole of that scope's question. ``"mine"`` asks a different one

        with "is the newest commit mine?", so an edit by anybody else on top of
        the caller's was enough to hear "nothing of yours to undo" about a
        commit still sitting reachable in history. It therefore searches back
        through :data:`FALLBACK_SEARCH` commits for the caller's most recent
        one; that bound is the same order as ``UNDO_LIMIT`` and is what
        ``log()`` itself will hand out, so this is one git call either way.

        A ``restore`` snapshot is refused in both scopes: undoing it would act
        as a redo, and repeated fallback undos would then oscillate between two
