"""Part search: the query grammar, the pure matcher, and the scanning engine
(PRD-027 FR3, design §2).

**On-demand scan with a stat-validated memo, not an inverted index** (ruling
2). A 1 000-part manifest is ~300 KB of JSON and its scripts are ~2 MB of
text; reading both costs tens of milliseconds cold and nothing warm, while a
maintained index would be a second source of truth that every write path —
`write_script`, `use_part`, a branch checkout, a merge, an undo, a restore —
would have to remember to invalidate. A memo keyed on ``(mtime_ns, size)``
cannot go stale: whatever changed the bytes changed the key, whoever changed
them and however they did it.

Three layers, and the split is deliberate:

* :func:`parse` — the grammar, a pure function of the query string. Every
  refusal lives here, so a caller never gets "no results" for what was really
  a typo.
* :func:`matches` / :func:`rank` — the matcher, pure functions of one row, one
  script text and a parsed query. They are what `frontend/js/query_model.js`
  ports (slice 5) and what `tests/fixtures/search_queries.json` pins: the
  browser answers metadata-only queries itself, the server answers anything
  touching script text, and the two must agree row for row and rank for rank.
* :class:`Engine` — the I/O: manifest rows, script text, the memos, and the
  ranking/limit/snippet assembly.

A result row says what it ``matched_on`` and carries a ``snippet`` when the
script body is the only **content** that matched — never "the only source at
all": a field term (`state:ok`, a filter chip) is in every returned row's
evidence and explains nothing about any one of them (`script_only`).

**Zero kernel calls.** Organizing and finding are not building: nothing here
touches `ensure_mesh`, `_ensure_built` or `_cache_key`, and a search over a
project whose parts have never been built is an ordinary, complete answer
(``state: unbuilt`` is a result, not an error). `tests/test_search.py` asserts
that with a counting kernel rather than trusting the reading.
