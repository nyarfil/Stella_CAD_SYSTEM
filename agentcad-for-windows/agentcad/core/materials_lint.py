"""Material card lint (PRD-028 FR3/FR8) — pure: no service, no kernel.

Two profiles:

``library``
    what the shipped ``materials_data/`` is held to, and what the CLI runs by
    default: every structural rule is an error, **every property must name its
    source** (``missing_citation``, naming the property — AC5), density must be
    a point, ``subcategory`` is required, a ``process`` block must carry one
    citation, and a source naming a licensed aggregator is refused outright
    (``disallowed_source`` — a primary source must be cited instead).
``user``
    what a hand-written project/global entry is held to: v1 flat entries are
    fine, an uncited property is a *warning*, a range density is a *warning*,
    and ``subcategory`` is optional.

Envelope checks (:data:`ENVELOPES`, per category) are always warnings: the
bands are sanity rails for a typo'd exponent, not a claim about materials
science, so they never block a publish.

A note on the ``schema`` code: the rules run over the RAW card first, so a
wrong unit is ``unit_mismatch`` and not a generic parse failure;
:func:`materials.normalize_entry` then runs as the backstop and its refusal is
reported as ``schema`` **only when a rule that normalization would also have
raised on has already fired** (:data:`_NORMALIZE_CODES`). One wrong thing
produces one finding, and a citation problem never hides a schema problem.

Everything that can be judged from the raw card is judged there — citations,
taxonomy, density-is-a-point — so a card that fails to normalize still gets a
complete report instead of one line and a re-run.
