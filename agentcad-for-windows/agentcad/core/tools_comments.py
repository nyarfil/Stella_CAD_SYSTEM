"""Tool pack: anchored review threads — the agent's half of PRD-008.

Installs the one seam the feature needs — ``service.comments``
(:class:`~agentcad.core.comments.CommentManager`) — and exposes the five tools
FR7 freezes: ``list_comments``, ``add_comment``, ``list_notifications``,
``resolve_thread`` and ``reopen_thread``. Handlers are thin delegations: every
lifecycle rule lives in ``core/comments.py`` and every anchor rule in
``core/anchors.py``. This pack measures nothing and resolves nothing itself.

Marking a notification read is deliberately **not** a sixth tool: it is
``POST /api/projects/{proj}/notifications/read`` in the route pack, because an
agent reading its own mentions needs no read cursor and FR7 freezes the agent
surface at five.

**The pack does not self-disable without git**, unlike ``tools_proposals`` and
``tools_versioning``: a comment is not a commit. ``.history/agentcad/comments/``
is just a directory when git is absent, and only tier-2 line remapping and
``proposal_hunk`` anchors degrade — by answering ``unverified`` and saying why,
which is the whole point of the four-state contract.

**Load order.** ``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks ``pkgutil.iter_modules``
**alphabetically**, so this module (``c``) is imported *second*, before
``tools_proposals`` (``p``), ``tools_run_checks`` (``r``) and
``tools_versioning`` (``v``). Two consequences the implementation obeys and
``tests/test_comments_api.py`` pins:

* ``service.proposals``, ``service.branches`` and ``service.merges`` do **not
  exist** when :func:`register` runs. ``CommentManager`` reads them inside each
  call (``getattr(self.service, "branches", None)``) and nothing here captures
  them.
* This pack assigns **nothing a later pack assigns unconditionally**. In
  particular it adds **no gate provider**: ``tools_proposals`` sets
  ``service.gate_providers = []`` unconditionally at ``p``, so an append from
  ``c`` would be silently discarded — and threads do not gate merges anyway
  (design Decision 20: threads inform, verdicts decide).

Every mutating tool returns the **post-state thread** under a ``thread`` key,
and every mutation publishes ``comment_changed`` from the manager — never
``project_changed``, which would snapshot history for a comment.

#: feature exists to prevent.
_RESOLUTION = (
    "Every thread carries a live 'resolution' block computed AT READ TIME "
    "(the stored anchor is immutable evidence of what the author pointed at "
    "and is never rewritten), with four different statuses: 'ok' — it still "
    "points at what it pointed at; 'moved' — re-matched at a NEW address, "
    "which the block carries (resolution.face_index, resolution.start/end) "
    "along with the score that earned it; 'orphaned' — the target is gone or "
    "no candidate cleared the tolerance, which is the CONTRACT and not a bug "
    "(the thread stays readable, listable and resolvable and keeps its "
    "last-known anchor); 'unverified' — WE DID NOT LOOK (the part has never "
    "been built, git is absent, the packet is frozen, or the anchor belongs "
    "to another branch). 'unverified' is a fourth fact, never a synonym for "
    "'fine'. Non-'ok' statuses always carry 'reason', and 'orphaned'/"
    "'unverified' always carry a 'hint'. ALWAYS address a face through "
    "resolution.face_index and lines through resolution.start/end — NEVER the "
    "stored anchor.face_index or anchor.start, which are the ordinals at "
    "creation time and are stale the moment geometry changes."

#: numbers, not a vibe — including the ones that got worse on the second look.

    "Face ordinals are NOT stable across a parameter change (measured: 87-93% "
    "hold, and one bundled part renumbered 20 of its 44 faces for a 1% "
    "tweak), so a face anchor is re-matched from the mesh-derived signature it "
    "stored. TWO classes were measured and they do not behave the same. (1) A "
    "PARAMETER CHANGE, 2 693 faces whose identity is known: about HALF resolve "
    "(ok/moved), the rest come back 'orphaned' — the safe answer, not a bug — "
    "and 2 of the 2 693 landed on the WRONG face. (2) A DELETED FEATURE, 327 "
    "faces that no longer exist at all: 323 orphan and 4 (1.2%) re-pin onto "
    "the surface that was underneath the one cut away. So a CUT-AWAY FACE CAN "
    "STILL RE-PIN: the measured survivors are a square pad on a square plate, "
    "where every number a mesh-derived signature has is the same on both. "
    "Treat a resolved face as strong evidence, not proof: if the answer "
    "decides something expensive, confirm with face_info. A repeated feature "
    "(a thread, a bolt circle) is genuinely ambiguous and orphans by design."

#: The hunk table (design Decision 8), in the words an agent has to act on.

    "A 'proposal_hunk' anchor points at ONE HUNK of a change proposal's review "
    "packet and re-maps by that hunk's BYTE-IDENTICAL header inside the "

    "same generation -> 'ok'; a regenerated packet carrying that exact header "
    "exactly once -> 'moved' to its new index (never 'ok', even at the same "
    "index — a new generation measured different commits, so nothing checked "
    "that the text is unchanged); the header rewritten, or now occurring more "
    "than once -> 'orphaned'/'hunk_regenerated'; a packet frozen by a merge -> "
    "'unverified'/'packet_frozen', because the diff it describes is history "
    "and the thread is the record of a review of exactly that. Reading a "
    "thread NEVER regenerates a packet (that would rebuild geometry on both "
    "sides and can move the proposal's state) — call proposal_packet yourself "
    "first, and address the hunk through resolution.hunk, never anchor.hunk."

    "AUTHENTICATION — the header is unvalidated until multi-user identity "
    "lands. Anyone may resolve or reopen any thread; only a comment's own "
