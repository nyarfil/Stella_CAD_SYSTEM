"""Deployment mode, the identity state directory, and the bind interlock.

Two modes, and **never a third**. ``local`` is what the product has always
been: a loopback tool with no credential, where the Host allowlist and the
same-origin check in :func:`agentcad.server.app._browser_request_allowed` are
the whole of access control. ``hosted`` is an instance on a network, where
every request resolves to an authenticated principal or to an enumerated
anonymous surface.

**Mode is explicit, never inferred.** Deriving it from "is auth configured"
fails *open* on a typo — an operator misspells a variable, the server decides
it is local, and a public interface serves an unauthenticated API. That is the
one failure direction that must be impossible, so an unrecognised
``AGENTCAD_MODE`` is an error rather than a default (design spec, Decision 3).

**The interlock** is the other half of the same idea:

===================  ==================  ======================
                     loopback bind       non-loopback bind
===================  ==================  ======================
``local``            today's behaviour   **refused**
``hosted``           allowed             allowed
===================  ==================  ======================

You cannot expose an interface without turning authentication on.

A "trusted LAN" mode was considered and rejected: a LAN is a network, not a
trust boundary, and this feature's whole thesis is that an account on a
005-lite instance reaches every project on it (005a design spec, Decision 1 —
PRD-006 confined the worker, and confinement is a process boundary, not a
tenancy one).
