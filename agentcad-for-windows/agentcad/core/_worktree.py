"""A tag-capable, reusable ``materialized_service`` (PRD-015 FR5, FR10-11):
check a project's ``.history`` tree out at a **branch, tag or commit** into a
throwaway detached worktree and drive an *ephemeral* :class:`AgentCADService`
rooted there — the mechanism that makes a released tag's BOM (and, later, its
release bundle) reproducible after the fact.

**Pure Python, no OCP/build123d import.** The kernel is *shared*, never
re-started (a second pool costs another pool's RAM and startup to run the same
builds).

Why a sibling of ``checks.py`` rather than a lift (design Decision 5, option
b): the dangerous atom — the muzzled service with its three non-negotiable
nulls — already lives at module scope as :func:`checks._ephemeral_service`, so
we import it directly and there is **no** third copy of those nulls. What
``checks.py`` keeps to itself, :meth:`CheckRunner._resolve_ref` /
``_materialized``, are methods bound to a runner's ``warnings`` list, its
``source`` provenance block and its determinism stage; lifting them would
thread that state through a standalone function and risk perturbing the
``test_checks_ref`` determinism/containment assertions (they compare exact
``source`` dicts and repo/worktree state). So only the worktree add/teardown
mechanics are re-expressed here — small, self-contained, and it leaves
``checks.py`` byte-for-byte untouched.

Containment is by construction, exactly as in ``checks.py``: the ephemeral
service is rooted at the throwaway cell, so its ``canonical_path_of`` — and
therefore ``.cache/`` and ``exports/`` — lands inside the cell and the user's
project is never written. The worktree is a *linked* checkout of the user's
``.history`` repo, so ``_ephemeral_service`` nulls ``bus.on_publish`` (no
snapshot commit into the user's repo), ``branch_resolver`` and ``write_guard``.
Teardown removes only the cell this call created with ``mkdtemp`` (0700, unique)
— it never deletes a directory it did not make.
