"""The built-in runner: `ChatEngine` driven from a **budgeted client**.

Design §8. Three things here are load-bearing and each is written down where
it is easy to lose.

**Budgets live in the client, not in the engine** (§8.3). `ChatEngine` has no
wall clock and a hard-coded ``MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN = 30``
(`agent/chat.py:50`). Rather than add a bench-shaped parameter to a product
class, the runner wraps the Anthropic client: :class:`BudgetedClient` checks
three ceilings *before* it calls the inner client and raises
:class:`BudgetExhausted` when one is spent. That exception surfaces inside
``ChatEngine._run_turn_locked``'s blanket handler (`chat.py:317-336`), which
repairs the history (`_repair_history`), publishes one ``chat_delta`` and
fires ``chat_done`` in its ``finally``. **The turn ends cleanly, the
transcript stays Messages-API-valid, and whatever the agent already wrote to
disk is scoreable** — which is AC8, bought with zero edits to `chat.py`.

**One engine turn per task.** The loader refuses ``turns >
MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN`` (§2 rule 3), so the engine's own limit is never what
stops a run and no continuation logic exists. That is the PRD's design, not a
workaround: the bench measures the product surface as it ships, and if 30 tool
calls is too tight that is a *product* finding raised in `chat.py`, after
which the bench measures the change.

**Nothing non-deterministic reaches `score.json`.** Timestamps, durations, the
model id, the agent name, the host and the usage counters all live in
``run.json`` (:func:`run_json`); `score.json` stays byte-identical across two
runs of the same submission (FR6/AC3), and the two documents sit side by side.

This module is OCP-free like the rest of `agentcad/bench/`, and it imports
`anthropic` only through `ChatEngine`'s own default factory — a run with no
key and no injected client is **refused** (:func:`require_agent`) rather than
attempted, so a stray API call out of a test is unreachable rather than
unlikely.

    * **path redaction** — the **cell** first, then the projects root. The
      order is deliberate and not longest-prefix: in a real run the projects
      root sits *inside* the cell, so redacting the cell first answers both
      and yields the one placeholder a reader can locate (``<cell>/projects/…``)
      instead of two that look unrelated. Both the resolved and the unresolved
      spelling of each root is replaced, because `mkdtemp` hands back
      ``/var/…`` where everything downstream says ``/private/var/…``.
    * **image elision** — see :func:`_elide_images`.

    **The task root is deliberately not a needle** (unlike `Scorer.score`'s
    `<task>`, which redacts it). Nothing a run produces can contain it: assets
    reach the model as inlined text named by their path *relative* to the task
    directory (`tasks.prompt_text`), and the agent is never told where the
    bundle lives. What is left to redact is the machine's own scratch — the
    cell and the projects root — and redacting a published task's public path
    on top of that would hide *which* task a transcript belongs to.
