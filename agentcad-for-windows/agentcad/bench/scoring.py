"""The bench scorer: six subscores, one copy, one deterministic `score.json`.

Design §3, §4 and §6. Three rules carry the whole module and every one of them
is a rule about *honesty*, not about arithmetic:

1. **Nothing is measured in place.** A submission is copied into a work
   cell and opened through a muzzled ephemeral service
   (`checks._ephemeral_service`), so the candidate's directory is untouched
   *by construction*: no history commit, no `.history/agentcad/` sidecar, no
   materialised branch tree, and `.cache/` lands in the cell. The run removes
   only the cell it created.

2. **`error` is the HARNESS failing to measure. Everything the candidate
   caused is a measured zero.** `not_applicable` is declared by `task.json`
   (weight 0) and never by a run. A candidate that is absent, broken, deleted,
   mesh-only, unbuildable or simply wrong is *measured*, and it measures
   **zero** with `status: "ok"` and a `reason`. Only budget truncation, a
   kernel that is gone, and a genuinely unexpected exception class are `error`.

   Getting this backwards is the one exploit this whole module has to close.
   Excluded subscores are renormalised away, so a run-decided exclusion lets a
   candidate **raise its total by destroying evidence**: delete the part
   script, break the assembly, hand back an STL. Every `error` arm below is
   therefore guarded by :func:`_blames_harness`, and every candidate-caused
   failure names itself in `detail["reason"]` instead.

3. **The rubric is injected into the copy, it RE-BINDS `SPECS`, only its own
   rows are scored, and a skip the candidate induced is a failure.**
   Whatever the candidate declared for itself is discarded, because the last
   module-level binding wins; `<copy>/specs.py` is replaced or **deleted** so
   a candidate-authored project block never scores;
   and the `specs` denominator counts only the rows the injected blocks own, so
   a candidate cannot dilute a failing rubric with ten filler parts that each
   declare a trivially-true check of their own. A `skip` normally leaves the
   denominator ("we did not measure"), but :data:`CANDIDATE_SKIP_REASONS` — a
   `clearance` check skipped `mesh_only`, an `interference_free` check skipped
   `no_instances` — is the candidate making a declared check unmeasurable, and
   it is scored as a failure for the same reason rule 2 exists.

The module is OCP-free by contract: it never imports build123d or OCP, and the
one mesh question it has to ask (`is this side an STL?`) is answered by suffix
here rather than by importing `kernel.refload`, which does import build123d.

`score.json` carries **no timestamp, no host, no path, no duration and no
client id** — the packages-provenance rule. Everything non-deterministic
lives in the sibling `run.json` the runner writes (design §8.6). That, plus
`round(x, 6)` applied recursively before serialisation, is the whole of AC3.

#: `specs` skip reasons the **candidate** induced, which the bench scores as
#: failures (design §4.3's skip rule, narrowed by an orchestrator ruling).
#:
#: A `skip` is normally "we did not measure", and PRD-003 keeps such rows out
#: of every fraction — right, when the reason is the machine. Two of
#: `core/specs.py`'s reasons are not about the machine at all:
#:
#: * ``mesh_only`` (`specs.py:1170`) — a `clearance` check whose side is an
#:   imported mesh. The candidate chose to hand back a mesh.
#: * ``no_instances`` (`specs.py:1120`) — a project-scope `interference_free`
#:   or `clearance` check with fewer than two instances placed. The candidate
#:   chose not to build the assembly the rubric measures.
#:
#: Left out of the fraction, either one **pays** a candidate for making a
#: declared check unmeasurable — the same exploit `_blames_harness` closes one
#: level up. So they are counted, and counted as failures.
#:
#: The rest stay out, because none of them is the candidate's doing:
#: ``fem_extra_missing`` is this machine without the `[fem]` extra,
#: ``unsupported_scope`` is the *rubric author* declaring a part-scope check at
#: project scope, and ``deferred`` is a rebuild-tier row a full run never
#: emits. (A budget row is an `error`, not a skip — `specs._budget_row`.)
CANDIDATE_SKIP_REASONS = ("mesh_only", "no_instances")

#: The kernel failures that are **ours**. A timeout is the budget or a hung
#: worker; a crash is a worker that is gone. Everything else a worker reports —
#: a script that raised, a contract the item did not meet, an OCCT failure
#: building the candidate's own geometry — is the candidate being wrong, and a
#: candidate being wrong is a zero, never an exclusion.

#: Everything a candidate's own files can throw on the way into the cell —
#: **and it is a wide net on purpose**, because every one of these was measured
#: escaping `score()` as a traceback:
#:
#: * a non-UTF-8 byte in a part script is a `UnicodeDecodeError`, which is a
#:   `ValueError` and **not** an `OSError`;
#: * a `parts/<id>.py` that is a directory or a dangling symlink comes out of

#:   `KeyError` out of `store.part_ids`, `assembly: "nope"` an `AttributeError`
#:   inside `store.open`. `ProjectStore` validates that the document parses and
#:   names a project; it does not validate the shape of everything under it.
#:
#: The width costs us the ability to tell a harness bug in `_prepare` from a
#: malformed submission, and that trade is deliberate: it buys the guarantee

        ``state`` is ``"ok"`` (built), ``"failed"`` (the candidate's doing —
        not in the manifest, no script on disk, a script that raised, a build
        that timed out, geometry OCCT could not make) or ``"error"`` (**ours**
        — budget truncation, a dead worker, an exception class we did not
        anticipate).

        The split is `_blames_harness`, and it is the fix for the sharpest
        version of the exploit rule 2 exists for: deleting `parts/<id>.py`
        makes `_ensure_built` raise `NotFoundError` out of `store.read_script`,
        which as a bare `except Exception` marked four subscores `error` and
        renormalised the candidate's whole score onto the one subscore left.

        **A build never raises a `KernelError`** — `service._build_with`
        catches it and answers ``{"ok": False, "error": payload}`` — so the
        classification for a build is made *here*, from the payload's type,
        rather than by `_blames_harness` (which still governs the defensive
        `except` below, and the kernel calls the other subscores make
        themselves):

        * **a timeout is the candidate's**, and it is named `build_timeout`
          rather than folded into `build_failed`. Nothing here shortens the
          build's own ceiling, so with no ``--budget`` in force the timeout is
          a fact about how long the candidate's script takes to run — a
          measured zero, exactly like a script that raises.
        * **a crash is the candidate's too**, named `build_crash`. This is the
          one place rule 2's "a kernel that is gone" does **not** apply, and
          the reason is that nothing else stops measuring when a build takes
          the worker down: `core/specs.py` treats a mid-measurement
          `KernelError` as a row payload, so `SpecRunner.run` survives a dead
          worker and returns real rows for every *other* part. A candidate
          shipping one reliably-crashing part and an otherwise-passing rubric
          would therefore have had `built`, `valid`, `geometry` and `metrics`
          renormalised away and banked a specs-heavy score — measured at
          0.24 → 0.60 on an `mts`-weighted task. Crashing OCCT is something a
          script chooses; being paid for it is the exploit rule 2 exists to
          close, and it outranks the symmetry with `_blames_harness` (which
          still answers `iou` and `check_interference` the other way, because
          there a dead worker means *that* measurement did not happen).
        * **either one becomes an `error`** — budget truncation, with a note —
          when a ``--budget`` has already expired. That timeout or crash is
          *our* deadline cutting the measurement short
          (`checks._budget_broke`'s rule, restated for a call whose ceiling we
          do not own), and truncation is an `error` everywhere in this module.
