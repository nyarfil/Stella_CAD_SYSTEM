"""`bench publish` -- the leaderboard, and the full-disclosure rule as code.

A leaderboard is the one artefact of this feature that is *marketing*, so it is
the one place where a soft rule would be worth the most and cost the most. The
rule is therefore mechanical and fail-closed (design Decision 12): a row that
does not disclose everything is **not rendered dimmed, not footnoted, not
flagged** -- it is rejected, the command exits 1, and **nothing is written**.
There is deliberately no override flag.

Input layout::

    <leaderboard>/rows/<row-id>/row.json
    <leaderboard>/rows/<row-id>/report.json     # `bench report --json-out`

The five rules a row must satisfy, each naming the key it failed on:

1. every key of `REQUIRED_ROW_KEYS` is present, and every string one is
   non-empty (`notes` may be empty; `config` may be `{}` but must be present);
2. `report.json` validates against the design-§10 report schema;
3. the row's `task_set` / `harness` / `agentcad` equal the report's;
4. `submission` and `transcript` are absolute `https://` URLs, or paths
   **relative to the row's own directory** (`<leaderboard>/rows/<row-id>/`)
   that stay inside it and exist there;
5. the report covers **every** task of the declared set -- a partial run is not
   a leaderboard row, and a task the report itself flags `missing: true` is a
   partial run just as much as an absent one.

**Rule 4 is narrower than design §12's wording, deliberately** (ledger D24).
§12 says "repo-relative paths that exist"; this module resolves a relative link
against the **row's own directory** and refuses anything that leaves it --
textually (no `..`, no absolute path, no scheme) *and* after `resolve()`, so a
symlink cannot walk out either. `../../../etc/passwd` is not a submission, and
the row directory is the only base that means the same thing to the validator
and to a reader of the page. Only an `https://` link renders as an anchor; a
relative one renders as text, because it points inside the leaderboard
directory and not inside wherever the page was written.

**The row's identity is its directory name, never the document's `id`.** That
is `report._score_paths`' ruling one level up: the directory is the one thing a
truncated or mislabelled document cannot lie about. A `row.json` that carries a
disagreeing `id` is rejected rather than silently given two names.

**An unreadable row document is a rejected row (exit 1), not a harness error
(exit 2).** A row we cannot read has disclosed nothing, which is exactly what
rule 1 exists to refuse; exit 2 is reserved for the input the *caller* named --
a leaderboard directory that is not there, an output path that will not take
bytes.

The page is **self-contained by construction**: one inline `<style>`, no
script, no remote asset of any kind, no web font. It carries no clock reading
and no filesystem path, and rows are ordered by `total` descending with ties
broken by id ascending, so republishing the same input produces the same bytes
(the FR6/AC3 discipline, applied to HTML).

OCP-free, like everything under `agentcad/bench/`.
