"""Holes, with a machine-readable record per call.

    from agentcad.toolkit import holes, patterns

    part, recs, warn = holes.clearance(part, patterns.bolt_circle(40, 6), "M5")
    part, recs, warn = holes.tapped(part, [(0, 0)], "M6", depth=12)
    part, recs, warn = holes.counterbore(part, [(20, 0)], "M8")
    part, recs, warn = holes.countersink(part, [(-20, 0)], "M6")
    part, recs, warn = holes.drill(part, [(0, 30)], 18.0)      # no table
    part, recs, warn = holes.clearance(part, [(0, 0)], "1/4", std="ansi")

Each call returns `(part, records, warning|None)`: the new part, the records
*this call* created, and one warning string naming what it found — the `safe_*`
contract, extended with the metadata the drawing callouts and PRD-021's DFM
rules read.

A record counts what came off, not what was asked for
-----------------------------------------------------
`count`, `positions` and `centers` cover only the instances the guard proved
removed material; the rest are listed under `dropped` and named in the warning.
That is not defensive tidiness — OCCT does not fail on a misplaced cut, it
succeeds and changes nothing, and the *aggregate* volume delta cannot be
attributed to an instance, so one successful cut used to hide any number of
no-ops (see `_guard` for the frame that measured it). `verify="off"` is the one
setting under which a count is intent rather than measurement.

**`record["verify"]` is the mode that was REQUESTED, not the tier that
answered.** It echoes the `verify=` argument, and it has to: the default runs
up to three different probes and a 50-hole call routinely uses two of them, so
there is no single tier for the record to name. The tier that actually decided
an instance is `record["instances"][i]["probe"]` — `"bbox"`, `"axis"`,
`"exact"` or `"off"` — and that is the field to read when the question is "how
do we know". `"verify": "bbox"` beside `"probe": "axis"` is not a
contradiction; it is the request beside the answer.

`record["provenance"]` carries the published sources behind the *diameter* —
`{standard, sources, corroborated, conflicts}`, unioned over every table row
that fed the hole (a counterbore has two). `corroborated` is true only for two
or more independent sources that agree, so a single-sourced or adjudicated
diameter says so at the point where it becomes a manufacturing callout instead
of only in the `hole_standards` tool. A `drilled` hole has no table row and
carries `None`.

`designation` is derived from the finished record by
`hole_standards.designation_for_record` — never assembled beside it — so a
reader can re-derive it and refuse a carrier whose text and numbers have come
apart. `designation_base` is the same callout with no depth qualifier, for a
reader that has *measured* that a recorded blind depth no longer holds.

Diameters are never invented here. They come from
`agentcad.toolkit.hole_standards`, which is the vendored ISO/ASME tables with
their provenance — `clearance(size, fit)["d"]` and `thread(size)["tap_drill"]`.
The one helper with no table behind it is `drill`, which takes millimetres
because a structural bolt hole *has* no fastener row (18 mm for an M16 is
none of ISO 273's M16 values), and its record says so by carrying no `size`.

**Every length crossing this module is millimetres**, including under
`std="ansi"`; only the designation text is in the standard's own unit. See
`hole_standards`' "Units" section — a millimetre formatted as an inch callout
is a 25.4x error that looks like a plausible number.

Where the records live, and why it is not a registry
----------------------------------------------------
The records ride **on the shape object the helper returns** (design Decision 4).
The alternative — a module-level registry the worker drains after `build(p)` —
is not fragile but wrong: the worker's `_SHAPE_CACHE` returns the cached shape
**without calling `build(p)`**, so on the second and every later build of an
unchanged part the registry drains empty and the records vanish silently.
Measured through the worker (changelog 0150): the attribute survives the cache
hit (the very same object comes back), survives LRU eviction and the real
rebuild that follows, and survives `handle_build`'s tessellation.

What it does **not** survive is any operation that returns a new object — also
measured: `safe_fillet`, `safe_bool` (both directions), a raw `part - tool` and
even a re-entered `BuildPart` + `add(part)` all come back without it. So every
helper that returns a part calls `carry()`, and `safe_fillet`/`safe_shell`/
`safe_bool` were taught to as well. For a raw build123d operation of your own,
call `holes.carry(new_part, old_part)` — or let slice 5's harvest tell you: it
compares `holes.created()` before and after the build and warns when records
went missing.

Naming a face without naming an ordinal
---------------------------------------
`plane` is a build123d `Plane`, or one of six names resolved **by predicate,
every rebuild** — never by face index, which renumbers on any topology change
(AGENTS.md, sketcher gotchas). A name resolves to the extreme planar face along
that axis, chosen by area, and the plane's origin is the part origin projected
onto it, so `points` stay part coordinates. As seen from outside the face:

| name | drills along | point `(u, v)` means |
|---|---|---|
| `top` | -Z | `(x, y)` at z = max |
| `bottom` | +Z | `(x, -y)` at z = min |
| `front` | +Y | `(x, z)` at y = min |
| `back` | -Y | `(-x, z)` at y = max |
| `right` | -X | `(y, z)` at x = max |
| `left` | +X | `(-y, z)` at x = min |

Ties (two coplanar faces at the same extreme) go to the larger area, then to
the lower `(u, v)` centre — documented so it is a rule, not an accident.

    under the tool — so a hole drilled into a part's own void reported
    `engaged`, raised nothing, and the aggregate "did anything come off?" check
    passed because a *different* instance had removed material. Measured on a

    A workplane says WHERE to drill. Which way is "into the part" is a fact

    frame can have its normal pointing inward. The bundled `angle_bracket`
    uses exactly one: ``Plane(origin=(0, 0, hz), z_dir=(1, 0, 0))`` on a leg
    whose material lies at +X, chosen deliberately because sliding a workplane
    along the hole axis is free while the named "left" face would rotate the
    tool and re-tessellate the part.

    build123d's `Hole` does not care — a thru hole is cut in both directions —
    which is why the primary route always produced correct geometry and only
    the things *derived* from the frame were wrong: stock measured 0 mm, the
    `exact` guard probed a tool standing in fresh air and reported
    `flush, engaged 0` on a hole that had just removed real material, and
    `_bore`'s `safe_bool` fallback built a zero-height cylinder (which does not
    quietly cut nothing — it fails the boolean outright).

    Placement is deliberately NOT re-based on this frame. The points are (u, v)
    in the caller's plane, so flipping the plane they are placed on would move
    the holes; this frame is used only to measure stock, to build tools, and to
    place fused thread solids.
