"""Threads and fasteners via bd_warehouse (Apache-2.0).

Real ISO thread geometry is exact but heavy (~9k triangles for an M8 screw at
tolerance 0.1) and can be slow to construct in some paths — notably
``bd_warehouse.fastener.ThreadedHole(simple=False)`` takes ~15 s and does NOT
auto-insert the thread. Prefer the wrappers here.

Guidance for agents:
  * Assembly previews / fit checks: use simple (cosmetic) threads — fast, light.
  * Manufacturing drawings / real mating: use real threads (external=True).
  * To tap a hole: bore a hole at ``internal_thread(...).min_radius`` (the tap
    drill), then fuse the internal thread — ``tapped_hole_thread`` gives you
    that thread solid ready to add.
