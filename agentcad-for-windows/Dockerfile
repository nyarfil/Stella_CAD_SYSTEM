# AgentCAD — hosted image (PRD-005a, PRD-006).
#
# TRUST: an account on this instance can execute arbitrary Python on the host;
# give one only to someone you would give a shell to. A part script IS
# arbitrary Python (agentcad/kernel/worker.py). Since PRD-006 the worker
# confines ITSELF in this image before it imports any geometry — Landlock +
# seccomp applied through ctypes, needing no capability and no bwrap binary
# (verified as uid 10001 under Docker's default seccomp profile): no network,
# writes only under /data/projects, /data/home/.agentcad, the server's work
# root and its own private temp dir, in hosted mode no reads of /data/state
# and nothing under /data/home except /data/home/.agentcad (a write root, so
# readable by construction), and memory/pids/CPU caps around it.
#
# It is still a single-purpose box, not a multi-tenant one: every project on
# the instance is readable and writable to every member's script, which runs
# as this image's uid 10001 (per-project ACLs are PRD-005). See
# docs/deployment.md, "Confinement and quotas".
#
# The image is multi-GB: the OCCT wheels that back build123d are. That is why
# the compose build is not a per-PR CI job (design Decision 12).

# FR1) so the shipped hosted image can actually serve passkeys — without it
# `routes_auth`'s passkey handlers 501 on every instance built from this
# image, and `docker compose` (the documented hosted deploy) is the only way
# most operators run AgentCAD at all.
