#
# The rubric. This block is appended to the END of the candidate's part script,
# so it must RE-BIND `SPECS` (never `+=`): the last module-level binding wins,
# and any `SPECS` the candidate authored for itself is discarded. Every
# constructor is imported under a `_bench_` alias because the candidate's own
# module namespace is in scope here — an alias makes a same-named module-level
# function in the candidate script irrelevant.
#
# These rows are the CONSTRAINTS only; the objective (minimise mass) lives in
# reference/metrics.json, where a graded one-sided window can express "lighter
# is better" and a pass/fail spec row cannot.
#
# `leg_thickness` is the row that makes this an optimisation rather than "read
# PARAMS, type the minimum". `thk` declares `min` 3.0 and the 4 mm floor binds
# a whole millimetre inside it, so the answer is the constraint rather than the
# end of the slider. Stated in measured terms, because grid=4 reads about
# 0.2 mm over the leg thickness itself: thk 3.0 -> 3.176 (red),
# thk 3.8 -> 3.992 (red), thk 4.0 -> 4.196 (green),
# thk 4.05 -> 4.247 (green, the reference), thk 6.0 -> 6.235 (green). The
# reference sits 0.05 mm over the floor in REAL material rather than leaning on
# the sampler's overread — a reference that passed only because grid=4 reads
# high would be a reference resting on a measurement artefact.
# The row is also the floor for a candidate that REWRITES the script, which is
# the cheapest way to lose mass and the one way this part can be made
# unbuildable. `bolt_pattern` counts the Ø14 hole edges directly
# (two circular edges per through hole, four holes) rather than trusting a
# parameter: at hole_d = 10 it reads 0 matching edges and fails.
#
# `material_density` is the row that stops the cheapest wrong answer of all.
# The objective is a mass, `mass_g = volume x density`, and the density comes
# from the manifest's material — which `update_part_script(material=...)` or
# `set_project_materials` changes in one call, no geometry touched. Measured:
# the starter re-materialled to `al6061` weighs 352.2 g and would clear both
# mass rungs. So the rubric measures the density the part is made of (A36 steel
# is 0.00785 g/mm³, 1% tolerance) AND reference/metrics.json carries a
# `volume_mm3` twin of each mass rung at the same ratios, which is
# density-invariant by construction. Either alone would leave the hole open.
