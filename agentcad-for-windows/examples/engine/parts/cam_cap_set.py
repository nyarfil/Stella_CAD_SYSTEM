"""Cam-cap set: three bearing caps + their six M5 screws, one compound.

Local frame matches the head. Each cap closes one cam saddle from above
(joint face z = 62, half-bore over the journal), screwed down into the
saddle's tapped holes. Modeled as one compound per head so the assembly
carries every fastener without exploding the instance count.
