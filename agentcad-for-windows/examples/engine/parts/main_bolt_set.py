"""Main-cap bolt set: six M8 socket screws, one compound part.

Built in the ENGINE frame (instance at the origin): two screws per main cap
at the block's tapped columns (x = -+28) under each bulkhead (y = -81, 0,
+81), pointing upward — heads seated in the caps' counterbores, shanks
running through the caps into the block. One compound keeps the assembly's
instance count sane while every fastener is really there.
