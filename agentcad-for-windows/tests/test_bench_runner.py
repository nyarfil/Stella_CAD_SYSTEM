"""The bench runner: a budgeted `ChatEngine`, a transcript, `run.json`.

PRD-024 AC8 — *"a task that exhausts its budget is stopped, flagged
`over_budget`, and still scored on whatever it produced"* — is the point of
this file, and every test here is **offline**: a scripted fake client is
injected everywhere, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is never read, and `run_task` refuses
to construct a real client when neither a key nor a factory is given. A stray
network call is not merely unlikely here, it is unreachable.

Everything takes the session-scoped `kernel` (`conftest.py`) and its own
projects root, so the file is parallel-safe and **nothing stops the kernel** —
it belongs to the session, and stopping it would break every neighbour.
`benchmarks/` is a read-only input and is never written to.
