"""PRD-009 acceptance criteria — one named test per AC (slice 14).

The mechanics are covered in depth by the eleven `tests/test_sketch_*.py`
modules: `test_sketch_v1_corpus.py` (the FR3 compatibility corpus),
`test_sketch_jacobian.py` (every analytic derivative against a central
difference), `test_sketch_diagnostics.py` (rank, DOF, the dependent set),
`test_sketch_initial.py`, `test_sketch_arcs.py`,
`test_sketch_tangent_direction.py`, `test_sketch_splines.py`,
`test_sketch_slots.py`, `test_sketch_ellipses.py`, `test_sketch_emit.py`,
`test_sketch_drag.py`, `test_sketch_on_face.py`, `test_sketch_roundtrip.py`
and the `slow` benchmark in `test_sketch_bench.py`.

This file is the **contract** layer: it walks each acceptance criterion of
`docs/prd/in-progress/PRD-009-sketcher-v2.md` through the surfaces a human and
an agent actually touch — the registered tools, the REST routes and a real
kernel build — so a reviewer can map AC → test without reading the unit
suites.

| AC7 | ``test_ac7_browser_half_evidence_is_recorded`` +
        ``test_ac7_the_sketcher_surfaces_the_changelogs_claim_exist`` |

**The browser halves are evidence checks, deliberately.** AC2's UI half, AC4's
chip and AC7 are claims about a real browser session; they were driven for
real (headless Chrome, screenshots, zero console errors) in slices 9, 10, 11,
12 and 13 and the changelogs are the record. The pattern — an evidence check
that fails if the record is removed, plus a *structural* gate that fails if
the feature is deleted — is PRD-001 AC6 / PRD-002 AC1 / PRD-008 AC1, and the
structural gate exists because the evidence check alone is exactly as strong
as the prose it reads.
