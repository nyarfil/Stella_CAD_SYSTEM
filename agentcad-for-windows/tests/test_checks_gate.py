"""The proposal slot and the ``checks`` gate (PRD-004, slice 6).

A check report becomes a *decision* here: ``agentcad check --proposal 3`` writes
``proposals/3/checks.json`` beside the packet, appends one audit line, and the
gate provider named ``checks`` replaces PRD-002's built-in placeholder so a
reviewer sees the verdict where the decision is made.

The rules pinned here, all of them deliberate:

* **Absent evidence is ``skipped``.** A proposal nobody posted a check to is
  byte-identical to today's placeholder — the gate can only ever block a
  proposal someone *did* post a check to. Opting in is the post.
* **Stale evidence is ``fail``, not ``pending``** — PRD-003's X8 lesson applied
  to this gate. ``ProposalManager.merge`` blocks a ``fail`` and *nothing else*,
  so a ``pending`` would have been merge-**permissive**: a green posted against
  an older head would silently wave through commits it never measured.
  ``fail`` with a re-run sentence is the only state that cannot lie.
* **Unreadable or unfinished evidence is ``fail``** for the same reason: a
  report that would not parse, or one whose budget ran out, is not a green.
* **The provider never raises and never answers ``pending``.**

Sections: 1. posting · 2. the gate · 3. installation · 4. the tool and the
route · 5. the CLI.
