"""DOF, rank, free entities and the redundant/conflicting split (PRD-009 AC3).

The four-case rectangle table below is the design spec's measured evidence,
turned into tests. Its point is that **the textbook method is wrong here**:
column-pivoted QR of `J.T` blames an innocent *original* `vertical` constraint
on two of the three over-constrained rectangles, because pivoting selects by
column norm — an artifact of residual scaling, not of intent. Declaration-order
greedy forward selection is correct on all four, because it blames the *later*
constraint, which is the one the user just added.

`test_pivoted_qr_blames_an_innocent_constraint_where_greedy_does_not` pins that
difference on purpose: a future "simplification" back to pivoted QR must fail
loudly with an explanation rather than quietly start pointing at the wrong line.

# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# the audit: no residual is stationary where the sketch pins its arguments
# --------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The tangency degeneracy was found three times because it was hunted one
# instance at a time. The property behind it is general and testable: a
# residual whose value sits at an extremum of the manifold the *other*
# constraints cut out has a gradient in their span, so it reports itself
# redundant while removing a real degree of freedom.
#
# `dof` is `n_params - rank(J)` and removing a constraint cannot change
# `n_params`, so "this constraint removes a DOF" is exactly "dropping it
# raises `dof`" — measurable without knowing anything about the residual's
# algebra. Every constraint in the corpus below removes a DOF, so none of them
# may be blamed. Audited by hand at the same time, and the two agree: the only
# residuals in the vocabulary whose value is a *distance at an extremum* are
# `tangent_line_circle` and `tangent_circles`, and both are now unreachable at
# a pinned junction. Everything else is linear in its arguments (`fixed`,
# `coincident`, `distance_x/y`, `horizontal`, `vertical`, `radius`,
# `equal_radius`, `midpoint`), a unit-vector product (`parallel`,
# `perpendicular`, `tangent_point_perp`, `tangent_dir`, `symmetric`) or an
# angle (`angle`) — all first-order where they hold.
