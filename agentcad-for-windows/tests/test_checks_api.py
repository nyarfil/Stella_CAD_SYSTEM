"""Geometry CI: the tool pack, the route pack and ``check_finished`` (slice 5).

Slice 4 gave the pipeline a command; this is the slice that makes it reachable
by an agent and by the browser, so what is pinned here is the *surface*, in the
four sections ``tests/test_specs_api.py`` uses: 1. registration (the schema,
the description contract, argument validation, the non-self-disable without
git) · 2. **load order**, which is the one thing about this pack that is not
obvious from reading it · 3. the run seam (``check_finished``, the last-report
cache) · 4. routes.

The load-order section is the reason the pack is called
``tools_run_checks.py``. ``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks
``pkgutil.iter_modules`` alphabetically and ``tools_proposals.register``
assigns ``service.gate_providers = []`` **unconditionally**, so a pack named
``tools_checks.py`` would load at ``c``, before ``p``, and slice 6's gate
provider would be silently thrown away. Both halves of that claim are asserted
here — the ordinal one against the real package, and the destructive one by
watching a sentinel provider disappear — because the failure it prevents is
invisible: no error, no warning, just a gate that never appears.
