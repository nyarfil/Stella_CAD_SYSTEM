"""PRD-006 slice 4 — the usage meter, its scope, health's object, `get_usage`.

Every kernel response now carries what it cost (slice 3's `on_usage` hook).
This is the service side of that: a meter that rolls the records up per
**project** and per **client identity**, the ContextVar that says which
project a kernel call belongs to, and the two surfaces that publish it —
`/api/health` (which also stops answering `sandbox` as a bare string and
starts answering the honest object) and the `get_usage` tool.

The meter is OCP-free and kernel-free, so most of this file drives it
directly with synthetic hook payloads — the same dicts `KernelClient._emit_usage`
builds. One test (AC7) wires the meter to the **real** session kernel and
proves two projects come back as two rows.
