"""PRD-006 acceptance — sandboxing and quotas, AC1–AC8.

One test (or one honest pointer) per criterion, each naming it in its
docstring, each graded against the shipped surface rather than a stub built
for the occasion.

| AC | Test |
|---|---|
| AC1 | `test_ac1_the_malicious_battery_is_named_and_gated` + `test_ac1_a_linux_worker_reports_itself_confined` |
| AC2 | `test_ac2_the_seatbelt_regressions_survived_the_refactor` |
| AC3 | `test_ac3_a_confined_kernel_reports_active_with_its_mechanism` + `test_ac3_windows_confines_with_an_appcontainer_or_says_why_not` |
| AC4–AC7 | `test_ac4_to_ac7_are_graded_by_the_supervisor_and_usage_suites` (pointers) |
| AC8 | `test_ac8_the_opt_out_drops_confinement_and_keeps_the_caps` + `test_ac8_a_kernel_that_cannot_confine_says_unsupported_not_active` + `test_ac8_the_full_suite_count_is_cited` |

Three of them are worth reading before you believe them:

* **The whole file is gated on `AGENTCAD_EXPECT_SANDBOX`, and that is the
  point** (design spec, Decision 13). Every containment assertion holds *when
  the live status is `active`*, and the environment variable turns "not
  active" from a skip into a failure. `ci.yml` sets it on all three jobs —
  Windows included since PRD-006b landed the AppContainer;
  `scripts/linux-test.sh` sets it too. Without it, a runner whose
  kernel lost Landlock would go green while confining nothing — which is
  exactly the silent degradation AC8 forbids.
* **AC4–AC7 are pointers, deliberately.** They are graded by tests that spawn
  real workers and allocate real memory (`tests/test_supervisor.py`) or drive
  two real builds through the meter (`tests/test_usage.py`). Re-running that
  work here would double a slow suite to restate a verdict; what this file
  grades instead is that those tests still exist under the names the criteria
  were signed off against.
* **AC8's "full suite green" is a claim about a *run*.** So it stays an
  evidence check on the newest changelog entry (the PRD-004 AC10 / PRD-011
  AC8 / PRD-012 AC8 precedent) rather than a number recomputed from inside the
  suite it is counting.

def test_ac8_the_full_suite_count_is_cited():
    """**AC8, third half** — "full suite green on the three-OS CI matrix" is a
    claim about a *run*, so this is the evidence check that a count is on the
    record in the close-out changelog (the PRD-004 AC10 / PRD-008 AC9 /
    PRD-011 AC8 / PRD-012 AC8 precedent).

    It stays an evidence check deliberately: recomputing the number would mean
    running the full suite from inside the full suite, and `--collect-only`
    counts *cases*, which is not what `make test` reports.

    The number is required **immediately before the word `passed`** rather
    than anywhere in the file: every changelog entry's own title is a
    four-digit number, so "the file contains a long digit string" is satisfied
    by an entry that cites nothing. The literal placeholder ("N passed") is red
    here on purpose, so the close-out cannot forget to fill it in.

    Neither the entry nor "the newest entry" is addressed by its **number**:
    this repo renumbers changelogs when two branches collide at merge
    (`b24ef66` moved 0188-0197 to 0200-0209), so a hardcoded `0219-` would be
    a test that fails for a rename it should not care about. The entry is
    found by its **slug**, and the newest one by the numeric value of whatever
    prefix it has, at any width.
