"""PRD-006 slice 2 — the Linux battery: a real worker, really confined.

Everything here drives the actual kernel worker with an actual part script
and asserts what came back. It runs on Linux only: locally through
`make test-linux` (which copies the tree into `agentcad:local` — Landlock is
not coherent over Docker Desktop's `fakeowner` bind mounts, so the tree is
COPIED, never mounted) and on the ubuntu CI job.

Decision 13's honesty gate: each test asserts containment *when the live
status is active*, and `AGENTCAD_EXPECT_SANDBOX=active` turns "not active"
from a skip into a failure. `make test-linux` and CI both set it, so a silent
degradation to `off` is red rather than quietly green.
