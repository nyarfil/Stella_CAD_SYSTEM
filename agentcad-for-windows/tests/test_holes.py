"""PRD-010 slice 4 — `toolkit.holes`: ISO geometry and the records that ride it.

Two things are under test and they fail differently. The **geometry** is
build123d's `Hole` driven from the vendored ISO tables, so a wrong number here
is a wrong hole. The **records** are metadata riding on the returned shape,
where the failure mode is silence: the design's original registry design would
have drained empty on a worker shape-cache hit and nobody would have seen a
thing (changelog 0150 measures it through the worker). So the tests below
assert what the records survive as carefully as what the holes measure.
