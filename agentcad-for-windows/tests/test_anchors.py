"""PRD-008 slice 2: anchor resolution without a kernel.

Everything up to section 7 is pure domain logic over bytes and strings — a
hand-built ACM buffer, a script's text, a fabricated old/new line pair — so it
carries no marker; only section 8 needs a real git blob and is marked there.
The geometry that needs a real build lives in ``tests/test_anchors_kernel.py``
(``slow``).

Sections: 1. the four-state vocabulary · 2. ``face_table`` over a synthetic
mesh · 3. the face matcher · 4. script_range tier 1 (AC3) · 5. the tier-2 line
map · 6. dispatch, the manifest-only kinds and the cross-branch rule ·
7. import purity · 8. tier 2 against a real git blob (the only cases here that
need git, marked ``integration``/``portability``).
