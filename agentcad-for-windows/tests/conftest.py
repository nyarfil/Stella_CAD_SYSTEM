    `locks.client_id_var` is a ContextVar with a default of `"local"`, and a
    ContextVar set at a test's top level is never restored — it survives for
    the rest of that xdist worker's process. Two kinds of test set one and do
    not put it back: a few set it directly (`tests/test_checks_gate.py`), and
    every in-process CLI run does it inside `cli.py` itself (`cmd_check` and
    the two package commands call `locks.set_client_id("ci")`, which is
    correct for a real `agentcad check` and has nowhere to be undone).
    Measured with a `pytest_sessionfinish` probe: `tests/test_checks_cli.py`
    alone ends the session with `client_id_var == "ci"`, and so do
    `tests/test_packages_cli.py` and `tests/test_prd004_acceptance.py`.

    That leaks into whatever module `--dist loadscope` happens to schedule
    next on the same worker, and "happens to" is the problem: adding one
    unrelated test module moved a leaker onto the worker running
    `tests/test_usage.py`, whose three identity tests assert the default and
    got `"ci"` instead. They had been order-dependent since they were written.

    This is a *snapshot and restore*, not a pin: a test that sets an identity
    on purpose still sees it for its own duration (`tests/test_branches.py`
    switches between `agent_a`/`agent_b` many times inside one test), and only
    the escape is closed. It is here rather than in `cli.py` because the CLI's
    call is right — a real `agentcad check` process *is* `ci` from that point
    on — so the fix belongs to the harness that reuses one process for
    thousands of tests, not to the product.
