"""PRD-006/006b — the Windows battery: a real worker in a real AppContainer.

Windows only — these need a real Windows host. `ci.yml`'s `windows-latest`
portability leg was dropped (we deploy on Linux/docker; it was intermittently
crashing the kernel worker), so in CI they run only via the opt-in
`windows-probe.yml`; locally they skip on non-Windows. The *shape* of the same
plan is asserted on every OS in
`tests/test_sandbox_plan.py`, with the Win32 entry points stubbed. What cannot
be faked, and is what this file exists for, is the OS actually refusing:

* the **job object** capping *committed* memory, so a breach is an allocation
  that fails inside the script rather than a process that dies, and the warm
  worker survives it (PRD-006);
* the **lowbox token** refusing the network (no ``INTERNET_CLIENT`` capability
  -> ``WSAEACCES``) and every path that carries no ACE for the package SID
  (PRD-006b), while a normal build and a STEP export still succeed — the
  load-bearing negative, because OCCT resolves DLLs from directories nobody
  enumerated.

Honesty (design spec, Decision 3/8): `confinement.status == "active"` is only
ever asserted from the worker's **own** ``TokenIsAppContainer`` self-report,
and under ``AGENTCAD_EXPECT_SANDBOX=active`` (which `ci.yml` sets on this row)
anything less is a red test rather than a skipped one.

**A residual this file does not paper over.** The package SID is *per
installation*, not per worker (design spec, Decision 2 — per-worker profiles
are explicitly out of scope), so the ACE one plan puts on its private temp dir
is an ACE for every worker of the same installation. The isolation proven
below is therefore "a directory this installation granted to nobody", which is
what protects the machine; two concurrent workers are isolated from each other
by DAC and by nothing else, unlike macOS's per-worker seatbelt profile and
Linux's per-worker Landlock ruleset.
