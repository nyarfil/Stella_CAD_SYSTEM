"""PRD-031a acceptance — the seeded marketplace catalog, AC1–AC9.

One test per criterion, each naming it, graded against the real anonymous
surface, the real (bundled) public catalog, the real PRD-007 containment and the
shipped frontend — never a stub built for the occasion.

Two ACs are partly a browser session, and a test cannot be one. **AC1 (the
browse → customize → download flow) and AC9 (the pages render, a slider drives a
rebuild) have contract halves driven here for real** — the anonymous
`TestClient` sweep, the mesh bytes flowing back, the STEP downloading — but their
**visual halves were never rendered by a browser** (`list_connected_browsers` →
`[]`, the PRD-005a/007 precedent). `test_ac9_browser_half_is_recorded_as_unverified`
asserts the record says so, which is the opposite of a pass.

Every build-path AC pins `AGENTCAD_KERNEL_POOL_SIZE >= 2` (the PRD-007 M-1
reservation): the customizer leaves one worker for members, so on a
single-worker pool `/variant` correctly 503s. CI pins the pool to 1 and the
session `kernel` fixture is one client, so a build-path test that does not pin
the pool passes locally on a multi-core host and FAILS in CI with a 503 — the
bug that cost PR #20 a CI round.
