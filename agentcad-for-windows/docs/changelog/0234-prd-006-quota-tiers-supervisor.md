## Summary
The caps stop being a plan and start being enforced. Linux gains its cgroup v2
tier (opt-in by delegation), a `/proc` RSS sampler and OOM/CPU exit
attribution; Windows gains a job-object backend; the client gains the
parent-side supervisor inside its request loop, which kills a ballooning worker
and *names* the reason; every kill path carries `details.usage`; and
`sandbox.report(kernel)` answers the per-facet health object. AC4 (a runaway
script is killed, attributed and recovered from), AC5 (a timeout carries the
wall clock it burned) and AC6 (a breach on one pool worker leaves its sibling
alone) pass on macOS and Linux.

## Changes
- **`kernel/sandbox_linux.py`** — `CgroupTier` (Decision 4). The tier is
  **opt-in twice over**: with `AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR` unset nothing is probed at
  all — no directory read, no cgroup created, the server's own placement
  untouched — which is the state of the shipped container and every laptop.
  `AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR=<path>` is Model 2; `=auto` is the own-cgroup (systemd
  `Delegate=yes`) route, a separate opt-in because it is the one that can move
  the server's own pids. `probe()` verifies every step and **every failure of a
  probe that was asked for reaches `plan.warnings`** ("falls back with a health
  warning", not silently). The `auto` route additionally refuses: **root**
  (`os.access` answers `W_OK` for uid 0 almost everywhere, so a root server
  would "discover" a subtree on any machine — that is activation by
  capability), a subtree whose **`st_uid` is not ours** (delegation means it
  was chowned to us), and the **root cgroup**. Ownership, write access, the
  controllers and `subtree_control` are all checked **before anything is
  mutated**; only then does the server move **its own** process into a `server`
  leaf (the no-internal-process rule), and a failure after that says so in the
  reason. `make_worker` writes
  `memory.max`, `memory.swap.max=0` (load-bearing: with swap at `max` the
  spike's 400 MB allocation under a 200 MB cap swapped instead of dying),
  `pids.max` and `cpu.max`; `attach` writes the pid after `Popen`; `oom_kills`
  reads the counter that separates a kernel OOM from the supervisor's kill and
  from a timeout kill (all three are `returncode == -9`); `release` rmdirs.
  `AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR=off` is an explicit "not even auto".
- **`LinuxBackend`** — `rss_bytes` reads field 2 of `/proc/<pid>/statm` times
  the page size; `explain_exit` answers `{"reason": "memory_cap", "tier":
  "cgroup"}` on an OOM-counter delta and `{"reason": "cpu_cap", "tier":
  "rlimit"}` on `-SIGXCPU`; `place_in` creates the worker's cgroup and returns
  False (with a warning) rather than raising, so the mechanism string names
  only tiers that were actually installed.
- **`live_uid_process_count()` now counts tasks, not processes.** `RLIMIT_NPROC`
  is enforced against the uid's `task_struct` count and a warm worker runs
  15-22 threads, so the per-process count under-measured a multi-worker pool by
  ~20 tasks per live worker. Measured: the second module-scoped worker in
  `tests/test_sandbox_linux.py` died inside `import build123d` with a
  `pthread_create` EAGAIN until this was fixed — the same fate a three-worker
  pool's third worker was one thread away from.
- **`kernel/sandbox_windows.py`** (new) — the job object is created **and
  configured in `build()`**, in the server process, and the process is only
  *assigned* to it after `Popen`; that ordering is what lets
  `quotas.mechanism` say `job_object+supervisor` honestly. Flags:
  `KILL_ON_JOB_CLOSE` always, `PROCESS_MEMORY` (commit limit) and
  `ACTIVE_PROCESS` when the knobs are set, plus a `CpuRateControl` hard cap as
  a share of the whole machine. `rss_bytes` is psapi's `WorkingSetSize`;
  `release()` closes the handle, which kills survivors. Confinement is
  `unsupported` with the reason "AppContainer confinement is PRD-006b"
  (Decision 7). Every `ctypes.WinDLL` lookup is inside a function, so the
  module imports on macOS and Linux and its plan shape is asserted there.
- **`kernel/client.py`** — the supervisor lives in `_request_locked` (Decision
  5): it samples the child's RSS through the backend at
  `max(0.05, sample_interval_s or 0.25)`, keeps the request's peak, and on
  `rss > memory_mb` sets `_breach` *before* killing and raises `kernel_crash`
  with `reason`/`tier`/`limit_mb`/`observed_rss_mb`. EOF consults `_breach`
  first, then the backend's `explain_exit`. Timeouts, breaches and crashes all
  carry `details["usage"]` from `_usage_stub` (`cpu_ms: None` — "not
  measurable from here" is not "no CPU was spent"). The parent's peak merges
  into the response's `usage`: it *replaces* a lifetime high-water mark (macOS,
  Windows), and is combined with `max` where the worker's own number is already
  per-request (Linux). `_emit_usage` hands `{"method", "usage", "ok",
  "worker"}` to the `on_usage` hook inside a `try/except` that complains once
  on stderr — a metering bug may never fail a build. A client built with no
  `writable_dirs` and no `quotas` still runs the historical 0.5 s poll with no
  sampler and no plan.
- **Backends gained `can_sample()`**, and the supervisor tier is named only
  where it is true. `NullBackend` (a platform AgentCAD has no support for)
  answers False: its `rss_bytes` is always `None`, so the request loop would
  sample nothing forever and kill nobody. Its quotas are now
  `{"status": "off", "mechanism": None, "limits": {...}}` — the caps are
  published, no tier is promised (Decision 8). `KernelClient._supervision`
  gates the cap on the same answer.
- **`kernel/sandbox.py`** — `report(kernel)` (new): the per-facet health
  object, read through `getattr` so a plan-free client answers it without
  raising. Confinement stays `active` only while the worker's own ping report
  agrees (via `client.confinement_holds`, so a *quota*-stage failure does not
  clear a confinement claim); a downgrade drops the mechanism too, and the
  worker's failures plus any post-plan backend warning land in `warnings`.
  `supported()` now answers **True on Linux** when the Landlock ABI is at least
  3 and the machine has a syscall table, which makes `status()`/`available()`
  — and so `/api/health`'s legacy string — truthful there. `_BACKENDS` gains
  `win32`. An opt-out on a platform with **no** confinement backend now stays
  `unsupported` instead of being rewritten to `off`: there is no switch to
  have flipped.
- **`kernel/pool.py`** — a `plan` property exposing worker 0's plan, which is
  how `sandbox.report()` reads a pool.
- **`plan()` cleans up totally**: the whole body now sits inside the `try`, so
  a failure anywhere — including in `SandboxPlan(...)` itself — releases the
  backend (closing a Windows job handle, removing a Linux worker cgroup) as
  well as removing the private temp dir. Until a plan exists, nobody holds any
  of it.
- **Every kill path measures its usage *before* `_kill()`**: the kill waits up
  to 5 s for the process and the EOF branch first waits for a return code, and
  neither is time the request spent. The unreachable worker (a broken stdin
  pipe) now carries `details.usage` too. A response that carries **no** usage
  envelope leaves `last_usage` describing the last request that did report one,
  rather than overwriting it with `{}`.
- **`kernel/_preamble.py` + `kernel/worker.py`** — the payload gains a `quotas`
  key: tiers the *parent* installed around the worker (`["job_object"]` on
  Windows, `["cgroup"]` on Linux). The worker applies nothing for it and
  reports it, because `denials.classify` refuses to name a denial no worker
  reported a live cap for — without it a job object's `MemoryError` would read
  as the machine running out of memory (Decision 9, and `denials.py`'s own
  docstring lists that case).

## Notes
- `make test — 4103 passed, 32 skipped in 525.47s` on macOS 26.6 (arm64).
- `sh scripts/linux-test.sh` in `agentcad:local` — **86 passed, 2 skipped in
  97.14s** (the skips are the delegated-cgroup test and one meter case). The cgroup
  tier was then exercised **for real** under Decision 4's Model 2 (host
  `mkdir /sys/fs/cgroup/agentcad` + `chown 10001`, `docker run
  --cgroup-parent=/agentcad -v /sys/fs/cgroup/agentcad:/cg:rw -e
  AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR=/cg`): **27 passed, 0 skipped**, including a real kernel
  OOM kill reported as `reason: memory_cap`, `tier: cgroup`. The recipe is in
  `test_cgroup_tier_when_delegated`'s docstring.
- Two numbers in the plan were changed against measured evidence and are
  documented in the tests that use them: the `RLIMIT_AS` test caps at 2048 MiB
  rather than the spike's 1536 MiB floor (a test pinned to a measured floor
  flakes on the next architecture), and the cgroup test caps memory at 1024 MB
  rather than 512 (a warm worker is 451-482 MB RSS, so a 512 MB cgroup would
  OOM-kill it during `import build123d` and prove nothing about a balloon).
- A worker-reported `script_error` deliberately does **not** gain
  `details.usage`: the worker answered, so its usage travels on `last_usage`
  and through the hook with `ok: False`, and copying a per-run `cpu_ms` into
  the error body broke the invariant that both drawing routes render an
  identical error (`tests/test_configs_drawing.py`). `details.usage` is the
  kill paths' contract.
- With a cgroup in force the supervisor can never fire: the kernel kills at the
  charge, so RSS never exceeds `memory.max` and the sampled value never crosses
  the cap. The two tiers share the `memory_mb` knob and the in-kernel one wins
  deterministically — which is why `tests/test_supervisor.py` sets
  `AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR=off` to pin the tier it is testing.
- The `auto` (own-cgroup) route is still **unverified on a real host** — no
  systemd machine with a delegated slice was available, as the spike also
  recorded. It is written to refuse rather than guess, and its refusals are
  unit-tested against a faked cgroup tree.
- Health does not publish the new object yet: `/api/health` still returns the
  legacy string, and wiring `sandbox.report()` into it (plus the docs) is
  Slice 5's step.
