# PRD-003 — Design specs as executable tests

- **Status:** completed — merged to main in PR #10 (AC1–AC9 verified)
- **Phase:** v4 — collaborative core
- **Created:** 2026-08-09
- **Origin:** competitive analysis (Aug 2026)
- **Depends on:** — (standalone; the v4 gates and v6 loops consume it)
- **Related:** PRD-002 (spec gates on proposals), PRD-004 (CI stage),
  PRD-015 ("released implies green"), PRD-019 (specs as objective
  functions), PRD-021 (DFM checks join the vocabulary), PRD-024 (scoring
  vocabulary)

## Problem & motivation

Design intent has nowhere to live as code. "Keep it under 120 g," "walls
never below 2.5 mm," "0.5 mm clearance to the chamber" are stated in chat,
tracked in spreadsheets, and silently violated three edits later — the
kernel validates that geometry *builds*, not that it *meets spec*. For
agents this is the missing half of the loop: the structured-error contract
tells an agent when it broke the model, but nothing tells it when it broke
the requirement.

The competitive evidence says this niche is ownerless: Valispace — the one
product that owned requirements↔engineering-budget traceability — was
absorbed into Altium (market_research.md, "The workflow ring"), and the gap
matrix scores executable design specs "implicit in tests — Valispace
(orphaned) — build-differentiated (design-tests, unclaimed)." No CAD ships
machine-checkable intent. Meanwhile the research consensus ("AI-native
CAD") is that validation, not generation, is the bottleneck — and a spec
layer is precisely what turns the kernel from a syntax referee into an
intent referee: TDD for hardware, where a human writes the spec and an
agent iterates geometry until green.

## Users & jobs

- **Design engineer (human):** pin budgets and constraints to the geometry
  they govern — versioned, diffed, merged like everything else — and see
  at a glance which are green.
- **Systems engineer (human):** trace a requirement id ("SYS-042") to the
  checks and parts that implement it, with live status.
- **Design agent:** receive intent as code, iterate until `run_specs` is
  green, and cite the report as evidence of done.
- **Reviewing engineer / proposal gate (PRD-002):** reject changes that
  violate declared intent without re-deriving it.
- **Optimization & bench harnesses (PRD-019, PRD-024):** use checks as
  objective functions and mechanical scoring.

## Goals

- G1. Intent is code: assertions over built geometry and assemblies live in
  part scripts (`SPECS`) and a project `specs.py`, with the same declared,
  validated contract as PARAMS.
- G2. Rebuild-time signal without friction: a failing spec is a warning
  during editing; it gates only at proposal/CI/release boundaries.
- G3. Requirement traceability: every check can carry a requirement
  id/URL, and the project answers "which geometry implements SYS-042 and
  is it green."
- G4. Graceful capability degradation: FEM-dependent checks skip honestly
  when the `[fem]` extra is absent — skips are data, never hidden.
- G5. One vocabulary, many consumers: the same check records drive the
  inspector chips, proposal gates (PRD-002), CI (PRD-004), release
  criteria (PRD-015), optimization objectives (PRD-019), and bench scoring
  (PRD-024).

## Non-goals

- Requirements management — we store requirement strings/URLs, not a
  requirements database or import pipeline.
- Check execution at change scale and reporting — PRD-004.
- DFM rules — PRD-021 (it registers new check kinds into this report
  shape).
- The optimization loop — PRD-019 (it binds objectives to these records).
- New tolerance modeling — PMI exists (`set_part_pmi`);
  `check_stackup` consumes the existing `tolerance_stackup` machinery.

## Experience

**Human path.** An engineer (or their agent) adds three lines to the nozzle
script:

```python
from agentcad.toolkit.specs import check_wall, check_mass, check_that

SPECS = [
    check_wall(min_mm=2.5, requirement="ENG-014"),
    check_mass(max_g=120, requirement="SYS-042"),
    check_that(lambda part, metrics: metrics["bbox"]["size"][2] <= 80.0,
               name="fits_fairing"),
]
```

and a project-level `specs.py` for assembly intent:

```python
from agentcad.toolkit.specs import check_clearance, check_interference_free

SPECS = [
    check_interference_free(),
    check_clearance("nozzle1", "chamber1", min_mm=0.5,
                    requirement="INT-003"),
]
```

The inspector shows per-part spec chips (green/red/grey-skip) that update
live on rebuild; a project Specs panel lists every check grouped by
requirement with measured-vs-limit; clicking a failing wall check reveals
the thin point's location. Nothing blocks editing — red is information
until a proposal tries to merge.

**Agent path.** The human states a budget in chat; the agent writes the
spec *first* (TDD), then iterates geometry: `set_params` → rebuild result
carries `specs: {failed: 1, checks: [...]}` → adjust → green. `run_specs
{project}` gives the full report on demand; `list_specs` reads declared
intent without building. In PRD-002's flow the agent cites the green
report as merge evidence.

**Handoff.** Specs written by either side bind both: an agent cannot
"forget" a budget stated last week, and a human sees an agent's
self-imposed constraints in plain code in the diff.

## Functional requirements

**Declaration**
- FR1. Part scripts may define `SPECS` as a list of records produced by
  `agentcad.toolkit.specs` constructors; a malformed `SPECS` fails the
  rebuild as a script error with `details.line`, exactly like a malformed
  `PARAMS`.
- FR2. A project may hold `specs.py` at its root defining `SPECS` over
  assembly instance ids; it is tracked, versioned, diffed, and merged like
  a part script, and executes under the same worker sandbox.
- FR3. v1 vocabulary: `check_valid()`, `check_wall(min_mm)`,
  `check_mass(min_g?, max_g?)`, `check_volume(min_mm3?, max_mm3?)`,
  `check_bbox(within_mm)`, `check_clearance(a, b, min_mm)`,
  `check_interference_free(min_volume_mm3?)`,
  `check_stackup(from_instance, to_instance, axis, within)`,
  `check_fem_static(fixed_face, load_face, load_N, max_vm_mpa?,
  max_disp_mm?)`, and `check_that(fn, name)` for arbitrary predicates over
  the built part + metrics. Every constructor accepts `requirement: str`
  (id or URL).
- FR4. Constructors are pure data with no kernel/OCP dependency —
  declaration is data, evaluation is the kernel's job; a `check_fem_*`
  spec declares cleanly on a machine without `[fem]`.

**Evaluation**
- FR5. Part-level specs evaluate on every rebuild; the rebuild payload
  gains `specs: {passed, failed, skipped, checks}`. A failing spec never
  fails the rebuild — geometry lands, the failure is signal (the warnings
  tier). Parts without `SPECS` incur zero added work.
- FR6. Each check result is `{name, kind, status: pass|fail|skip|error,
  measured, limit, requirement?, location?, message}`; `location` is a
  world point when the underlying analysis yields one (the wall check's
  thinnest point does today).
- FR7. `run_specs {project, part_id?}` evaluates everything (or one part):
  part specs plus project specs, returning the full report with
  per-requirement grouping (`requirements: {<id>: {checks, status}}`).
- FR8. Skip semantics: `check_fem_*` without the `[fem]` extra returns
  `{status: "skip", reason: "fem_extra_missing", hint}` — the `run_specs`
  tool itself always registers (the never-show-unrunnable-tools rule
  governs tools; skips are data a CI `--strict` mode can escalate). Checks
  needing booleans or walls on mesh-only reference parts skip with
  `reason: "mesh_only"`.
- FR9. A spec that itself crashes (bad predicate, unknown instance id)
  reports `status: "error"` with traceback details — distinct from a
  failing check and from a build error.
- FR10. Results are deterministic and cacheable under the content-hash
  discipline: unchanged script + params + spec inputs reuse the stored
  result (PRD-004's speed depends on this).

**Gating & traceability**
- FR11. A service seam `evaluate_specs(project, ref?) -> {status:
  green|red|skip, failures, skips}` returns gate-shaped status for any ref
  — the shape PRD-002 renders in its Checks tab and PRD-004 posts.
- FR12. Requirement strings flow end to end: declared → evaluated →
  grouped in `run_specs` → visible in the Specs panel. A requirement with
  zero checks does not exist to us (no requirements database — non-goal).
- FR13. UI: per-part spec chips in the inspector, live on rebuild events;
  a project Specs panel grouped by requirement showing measured vs limit.

## Agent surface

New tools: `run_specs {project, part_id?}` · `list_specs {project,
part_id?}` (declared specs with requirements, no evaluation).
Changed: rebuild-returning tools (`update_part_script`, `set_params`,
`set_solid_materials`) gain the `specs` summary in their post-state.
No new error type: spec failures are data in reports; malformed
declarations are the existing script-error family; gate consumption
belongs to PRD-002/PRD-004.

## Technical approach

- **Toolkit module** `agentcad/toolkit/specs.py` — pure-data constructors
  importable from part scripts (re-exported from `toolkit/__init__.py`),
  zero kernel imports.
- **Worker handler pack** `agentcad/kernel/handlers/specs.py` — evaluates
  part-level checks against the built shape via the toolbox (`metrics`
  plus the wall/section machinery the analysis pack already has);
  `check_that` predicates run inside the sandboxed worker with the built
  part and metrics dict.
- **Service orchestration** — project-level checks reuse existing paths:
  interference via the `check_interference` machinery, stack-ups via
  `tolerance_stackup`, FEM via the fem handler pack when present. One
  genuinely new geometry op: a `clearance` handler (minimum distance
  between two placed shapes via BRepExtrema) joins the analysis pack.
- **Tool pack** `agentcad/core/tools_specs.py` + **route pack**
  `agentcad/server/routes_specs.py`; `evaluate_specs` lands as a service
  seam (like `mates.resolve`), not a fork of service internals.
- **Frontend**: chips + Specs panel in `inspector.js`; viewport location
  markers deferred.
- **Storage**: none — part specs live in scripts and `specs.py` is a
  tracked file, so PRD-001 versions, diffs, and merges intent for free.
  The `CHEATSHEET` in `templates.py` gains a SPECS section
  (authoring-facing surface change).

## MVP & phasing

- **MVP:** constructors (valid, wall, mass, volume, bbox, clearance,
  interference_free, that) + part `SPECS` + project `specs.py` evaluation
  + `run_specs`/`list_specs` + rebuild summaries + inspector chips; the
  rocketry example ships real specs.
- **Phase 2:** `check_stackup` + `check_fem_static` with skip semantics,
  the requirement-grouped panel, result caching (FR10), thin-point
  markers in the viewport.
- **Phase 3:** the `evaluate_specs` gate consumed by PRD-002 (red gate on
  proposals) and PRD-004 (CI stage); PRD-019 binds objectives to the same
  records; PRD-021 registers DFM packs as new check kinds in this report
  shape.

## Acceptance criteria

- AC1. The rocketry example ships specs — chamber mass budget, nozzle wall
  minimum, flange bolt-circle clearance — green as shipped; thinning the
  nozzle wall via `set_params` turns `run_specs` red naming `check_wall`
  with measured vs limit and the thin point's location (test on a copy).
- AC2. A rebuild with a failing spec still lands geometry and returns
  `ok: true` with the failure in `specs` (test).
- AC3. `check_fem_static` reports skip + hint without `[fem]` and
  evaluates with it (paired tests, `importorskip` pattern; suite green
  without the extra).
- AC4. Project `specs.py`: the clearance check reports the measured
  minimum distance for a too-close pair, and `check_interference_free`
  names the offending pair (tests).
- AC5. A `check_that` predicate that raises reports `status: "error"` with
  a traceback, not a crashed rebuild (test).
- AC6. Requirement strings group correctly in the `run_specs` report, and
  `list_specs` returns declarations without triggering any build (tests).
- AC7. `evaluate_specs(project, ref)` returns green for a tagged good
  state and red for a branch with a broken budget (test over PRD-001
  refs).
- AC8. Spec chips render and live-update in a real browser session on
  rebuild, zero console errors.
- AC9. Full suite green (count cited); rebuild latency for spec-less parts
  is unchanged — spec evaluation provably skipped when no `SPECS` exist
  (test).

### Verification (slice 7)

Every criterion above has a named test in `tests/test_prd003_acceptance.py`,
which walks it end to end through the real stack — tools, the kernel, git and
the shipped `examples/rocketry` (on a copy) — rather than through the unit
seams (`tests/test_specs_toolkit.py`, `tests/test_specs_kernel.py`,
`tests/test_specs.py`, `tests/test_specs_api.py`, `tests/test_specs_gate.py`,
205 tests between them):

| AC | Proving test |
|----|---|
| AC1 | `test_ac1_rocketry_ships_green_specs_and_thinning_turns_red` (rocketry, on a copy: green as shipped across `nozzle:mass_max`, `nozzle:wall_min`, `flange:bolt_circle_ligament` and the two assembly gaps; `set_params {"wall": 2.0}` turns the report red naming `nozzle:wall_min` with measured 0.707 mm vs `{"min_mm": 0.8}` and a non-null location) |
| AC2 | `test_ac2_failing_spec_still_lands_geometry` (same edit: `ok: true`, the mesh on disk, the failure in `specs`, and the same verdict on `get_part`) |
| AC3 | `test_ac3_fem_check_skips_without_extra_and_evaluates_with_it` (paired in one test: the skip half is forced on every machine, the evaluation half runs when the extra imports; the suite is green without it) |
| AC4 | `test_ac4_project_specs_measure_clearance_and_name_interference` (a 0.4 mm gap measured against a 1.0 mm limit; the overlapping pair named in `details.pairs`) |
| AC5 | `test_ac5_raising_predicate_is_an_error_not_a_crash` (`status: "error"` + traceback, `ok: true`, the sibling check still reported, the worker still answering) |
| AC6 | `test_ac6_requirements_group_and_list_specs_does_not_build` (`list_specs` issues zero `build` calls; the declared and evaluated requirement maps are asserted equal) |
| AC7 | `test_ac7_evaluate_specs_green_for_a_good_branch_red_for_a_broken_one` |
| AC8 | `test_ac8_spec_chips_verified_in_browser` (evidence check over `docs/changelog/0092-spec-chips-ui.md`) |
| AC9 | `test_ac9_specless_parts_add_no_kernel_work` + the full-suite run cited in `docs/changelog/0093-specs-docs-and-acceptance.md` |

The **browser half of AC8** ("spec chips render and live-update in a real
browser session on rebuild, zero console errors") was driven for real in a
headless-Chrome session in slice 6 — a green → red → green `wall_min` chip in
both themes, screenshots and a clean console recorded in
`docs/changelog/0092-spec-chips-ui.md` — and the evidence test above fails if
that record is removed. Re-driving a browser from the test suite is
deliberately not done (the PRD-001 AC6 / PRD-002 precedent).

**AC7 is verified in its reworded form.** "Green for a tagged good state" is
not implementable as written: `git rev-parse` searches tags before branches,
so PRD-001's X1 rule makes every spec ref resolve as a *branch* and a tag a
`validation_error` — a tag must never answer for a branch. The test asserts
green for a good branch, red for a branch with a broken budget, and that a tag
ref raises, which is the decision the codebase actually makes.

### As built — divergences from this document

1. **A structurally malformed `SPECS` is reported as data, not as a failed
   rebuild.** FR1 holds for the common case for free: constructors validate
   eagerly, so a bad argument raises during module exec and is already a
   `script_error` with `details.line`. The residue (`SPECS = "hello"`, a
   non-constructor dict) is reported as `specs.error` on an
   otherwise-successful rebuild — failing a build over a broken *assertion*
   contradicts FR5 and would take away the geometry you need to fix it.
2. **`metrics["bbox"]` has `min`/`max`, not `size`.** The `check_that` example
   in Experience should read `max[2] - min[2]` (or use `check_bbox`).
3. **A check record's `limit` is a dict**, and the record carries `id`,
   `scope`, `part`, `unit` and `details` beyond FR6's list: two-sided checks
   have two limits, and a flat list of records needs a join key
   (`<part>:<name>` / `project:<name>`).
4. **No new event.** FR13's "live on rebuild events" is met by the existing
   `rebuild_finished` → `refreshPartDetail` → `get_part` path, which now
   carries `specs`.
5. **Four tools, not two:** `set_project_specs` and `get_project_specs` are
   additive — FR2 gives `specs.py` no writer, and the agent path ("the agent
   writes the spec first") is unreachable without one. There is **no
   `evaluate_specs` tool**: FR11 is a service seam (`SpecRunner.evaluate_specs`)
   consumed by the gate, exactly as written, and `run_specs {ref}` is its
   agent-facing form.
6. **Evaluation is tiered: a rebuild runs the shape tier only.** Assembly and
   FEM tiers are deferred to `run_specs`/`evaluate_specs` and reported at
   rebuild time as `skip`/`deferred` — a 600 s solve inside a slider drag is
   not "without friction".
7. **The proposal gate is fail-closed and evaluates the SOURCE branch.** A
   declared check that was not evaluated is `fail`, not `pending`; the gate
   answers "is the proposed state green", not "will the merge be green" (that
   is PRD-004). `allow_invalid` does not waive it.
8. **Project-scope `check_that` is not supported in v1** — there is no single
   built shape to hand a predicate. Both directions of a scope mismatch (a
   part-scope check in `specs.py`, a project-scope check in a part script) are
   reported as `skip`/`unsupported_scope`: counted, named, never dropped.
9. **`clearance` is a method on a new kernel pack**, not a `kind` on `analyze`:
   `analyze` takes one script and applies no world transform, so a
   two-placed-shapes measurement is a different signature.
10. **The MVP UI is the chip strip only.** The requirement-grouped project
    Specs panel and the viewport thin-point marker stay Phase 2 (as the MVP
    section says); FR13's requirement grouping ships in the `run_specs` report.
11. **The pack does not self-disable without git.** Unlike proposals and
    versioning, specs are a property of the working tree; only `ref=` and the
    gate need branches, and those raise a `validation_error` naming git.
12. **A part that declares nothing is absent from the report**, and its rebuild
    payload carries `specs: null` ("none declared", which is not "not
    evaluated"); a *failed* build carries no `specs` key at all. Calling a part
    with no stated intent "green" would assert something we did not measure.
13. **The declaration-failure field is `declaration_error`, not `error`.** A
    top-level `error` key is the tool-envelope failure marker everywhere in
    this repo, and a *reported* failure must not wear that name.
14. **`check_fem_static`'s faces are axis/side selectors**
    (`{"axis": "z", "side": "max"}`, the shape `fem_static` already takes), and
    at least one of `max_vm_mpa` / `max_disp_mm` is required — a check with no
    limit can neither pass nor fail.
15. **AC1's "nozzle wall minimum" ships in *measured* terms.** `check_wall` is
    a sampled ray cast, so on the rocketry nozzle it finds the chamfered exit
    lip (0.2 × `wall`) rather than the barrel: 1.02 mm measured at `grid=4` for
    a 3.0 mm wall. The shipped limit (`min_mm=0.8`, `grid` pinned) is that
    measurement's expression of ENG-014, not the nominal wall — and the same
    caveat is why the flange's bolt-circle check is declared at `grid=4`, where
    it measures the real 6.5 mm ligament. Documented in
    `docs/part-authoring.md` and `AGENTS.md`; a medial-axis wall measurement
    would be a new PRD.
16. **A proposal that weakens a spec still has no packet row.** `packet.py`
    builds rows only from `parts/*.py`, so the gate carries
    `details.specs_py_changed` as the flag. A full `specs` section in the
    packet is a `packet.py` change and remains a named PRD-002-Phase-2 /
    PRD-008 gap.

## Risks & open questions

- **Predicates are arbitrary code** — the trust model is unchanged (part
  scripts already execute in the sandboxed worker); document that specs
  run confined and never in the server process.
- **Instance-id coupling** — project specs name assembly instances; a
  rename breaks the spec, surfaced as `status: "error"` naming the
  missing id — honest, not silent. A rename-refactor tool could later
  rewrite both sides.
- **Severity is contextual, not declared** — rebuild warns, boundaries
  gate. Open question: does a per-spec `advisory: true` flag (reported,
  never gating) earn its place? Defer until a real user asks.
- **Clearance cost** — BRepExtrema on complex pairs can be slow; the
  per-request kernel timeout applies; measure and document limits.
- **Vocabulary sprawl** — every analysis wants a `check_`. Rule: a
  constructor lands only when its measurement already exists as a
  handler; PRD-021 is the sanctioned expansion path.

## Competitive references

Valispace owned requirements↔engineering-budget traceability and was
absorbed into Altium — the niche is ownerless (market_research.md, "The
workflow ring"). Onshape and SolidWorks ship no executable design intent;
budgets live in spreadsheets that silently diverge from the model.
Simulation tools check physics, not intent. The gap matrix calls
design-tests "unclaimed — build-differentiated." We differ: specs are code
in the same repo as the geometry, evaluated by the same kernel that
referees every change, and they double as the agent's termination
condition (PRD-018/019), the merge gate (PRD-002/004), and the benchmark
scoring vocabulary (PRD-024) — TDD for hardware, not a requirements
database.
