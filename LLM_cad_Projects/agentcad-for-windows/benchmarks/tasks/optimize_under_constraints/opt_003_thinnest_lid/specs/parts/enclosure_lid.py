#
# The rubric. This block is appended to the END of the candidate's part script,
# so it must RE-BIND `SPECS` (never `+=`): the last module-level binding wins,
# and any `SPECS` the candidate authored for itself is discarded. Every
# constructor is imported under a `_bench_` alias because the candidate's own
# module namespace is in scope here — an alias makes a same-named module-level
# function in the candidate script irrelevant.
#
# These rows are the CONSTRAINTS only; the objective (minimise material) lives
# in reference/metrics.json, where a graded one-sided window can express "less
# is better" and a pass/fail spec row cannot.
#
# No `check_wall`: measured on this part at grid=4 the sampler reports
# 0.200 mm on EVERY variant in range — it lands on the 0.2 mm BOSS_RELIEF
# recess in the plate underside, not on a wall — so a floor under it would be
# red on the reference itself and could neither pass nor discriminate.
# `lip_depth` and `plate_thickness` are the two halves of the fit stated in the
# terms a bounding box can actually see: the reference reads z in
# [-1.5, +2.0], and both floors sit 0.05 mm inside that. They are also the rows
# that make this an optimisation rather than "read PARAMS, type the minimum":
# `lid_t` declares `min` 1.0 and `lip_h` declares `min` 0.8 — what the script
# prints, not what this enclosure allows — so both floors bind a whole
# millimetre inside the declared range. Measured, the end of both sliders
# (1.0 / 0.8) is red on both rows and scores 0.775.
# `screw_holes` counts the Ø3 hole edges directly (one circular edge per
# countersunk hole, four holes) rather than trusting a parameter: at
# screw_d = 5 it reads 0 matching edges and fails. It is also the third row
# a too-thin plate loses, and for a real reason: the 90° countersink at
# csk_r 3.0 needs 1.5 mm of depth, so under a 2 mm plate it breaks through and
# the cylindrical hole it was countersinking is gone (48 faces at the
# reference, 44 at lid_t 1.5).
