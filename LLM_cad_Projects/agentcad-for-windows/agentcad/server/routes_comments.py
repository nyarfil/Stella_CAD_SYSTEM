"""Review-thread routes: the browser's half of PRD-008.

    GET    /api/projects/{proj}/comments   ?part_id=&state=&kind=&branch=
                                           &proposal=&anchor_status=
                                           &resolve_anchors=
    POST   /api/projects/{proj}/comments   {anchor|thread, body, attachments}
    GET    /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}
    POST   /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}/resolve
    POST   /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}/reopen
    PATCH  /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}/comments/{cid}   {body}
    DELETE /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}/comments/{cid}
    GET    /api/projects/{proj}/comments/{tid}/audit
    GET    /api/projects/{proj}/notifications                   ?unread=
    POST   /api/projects/{proj}/notifications/read              {ids?}

The first four verbs and ``GET …/notifications`` are registry passthroughs,
because they are exactly the agent surface (``list_comments`` /
``add_comment`` / ``resolve_thread`` / ``reopen_thread`` /
``list_notifications``) and one implementation must serve both. The rest are
**not tools on purpose**: reading one thread, editing or deleting your own
comment, reading an audit log and moving a read cursor are panel affordances,
and FR7 freezes the agent surface at five tools. They call ``service.comments``
directly, whose structured errors the app's ``AppError`` handler maps
identically.

Both notification routes answer for **the identity of the request** — the
``X-Agent-Id`` the app's middleware bound — and never take one as an argument:
a client asking for somebody else's inbox would be asking a question this
server has no way to authorize.

Body keys are whitelisted per route (the registry rejects unknown arguments,
and ``null`` must read as "omitted", not as an argument) — never ``**body``.
That is also what keeps a client from posting ``state`` or ``author`` into a
thread document: those are the server's to stamp.

Ordinary failures are re-raised as ``NotFoundError``/``ValidationError``/
``ConflictError`` so the app's handlers map them to 404/422/409 like every
other REST route, and any OTHER error type (``invalid_arguments``, …) is a 422
rather than a 200 body nobody inspects. ``_BODY_ERRORS`` is **empty** and that
is the feature's philosophy rather than an omission: an ``orphaned`` or
``unverified`` anchor is *payload* — the honest answer to "where does this
point now" — and never an exception. Only "there is no such project, thread or
comment", "that anchor is invalid" and "that attachment is outside exports/"
are HTTP errors.

``GET`` with ``resolve_anchors=false`` is the cheapest listing: no resolution
work at all, for a panel that only needs counts and bodies.
