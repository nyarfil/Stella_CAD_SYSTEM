"""Route pack: enrolment, login, sessions and account management (PRD-005a).

Registered like every other pack, and inert in local mode — every handler
begins by asking :func:`security.current_config` and answers ``404`` when
there is none, so a local instance is byte-identically what it was.

The configuration comes from ``security.current_config()`` rather than from
``service``, because identity is **app-layer** state. Putting it on the
service is what would drag it into ``checks._ephemeral_service`` and
``gate._ephemeral_service``, and PRD-004/011 being unaffected *by
construction* is the property this feature must not spend.

Roles are checked here rather than in the middleware: there are five
admin-only handlers, and a path-pattern list in the guard would be a second
place to get it wrong.

        and a member *with* passkeys all get byte-shaped-identical options

        oracle on an unauthenticated endpoint: it would leak both that a handle
        exists and the ids of its credentials, and it is exactly what
        `_LOGIN_FAILED` exists to avoid on the password door. A `handle` may
        still be sent (older clients do) but it is **ignored** here — the
        credential the browser returns identifies its own owner, resolved by id
        in `login/complete`, so the discoverable-credential flow needs no hint

        already give.

        sign-in two-factor by default rather than possession-only. The virtual
        and every platform authenticator set the UV flag; a roaming key without
        a PIN is the only thing this turns away, and turning it away is the
        secure default. (Documented for `docs/deployment.md` — passkeys are 2FA
