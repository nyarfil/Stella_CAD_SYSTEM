"""2D sketch constraint solver — a typed residual IR with analytic Jacobians.

Runs in the **server** process (`core/tools_sketch.py` imports it) as well as
in part scripts, so it must never import build123d/OCP. numpy and scipy are
declared dependencies of this package for exactly that reason.

Entities:
  point  (x, y)            -- free or fixed
  line   (p1, p2)          -- reference to two points (no own params)
  circle (center, r)       -- center point ref + radius param (free or fixed)
  arc    (center, r, t1, t2) -- centre point ref + 3 own params; its endpoints
                             are the **virtual handles** `<name>.start` and
                             `<name>.end`
  spline (points)          -- an ordered list of named points, degree 3,
                             non-periodic; no params of its own
  slot   (c1, c2, width)   -- compiled at ingestion into two arcs + two lines
                             sharing one radius param

Constraint vocabulary v1:
  fixed, coincident, distance, distance_x, distance_y,
  horizontal, vertical, parallel, perpendicular, angle,
  point_on_line, point_on_circle, radius, equal_radius,
  tangent (line-circle, with optional tangency point; circle-circle
  external/internal), midpoint.

Added in PRD-009 slice 5:
  tangent (one name, dispatched over the pair's kinds), symmetric,
  equal_length, concentric — and `radius`, `equal_radius`, `point_on_circle`,
  `tangent_line_circle`, `tangent_circles` now accept arcs, because an arc's
  radius is a radius.

## Arcs and virtual handles

An arc owns exactly three parameters (`r`, `theta1`, `theta2`; two when
`fixed_r`), plus the two its centre point owns if that point is new. Its
endpoints are **derived**: `arc1.start` and `arc1.end` are names that resolve
through `PointRef` to `(cx + r cos t, cy + r sin t)` and to a gradient
chain-ruled over `{cx, cy, r, theta}`. So `coincident {p: "arc1.end",
q: "p3"}` is the same two rows as any other coincidence, and the whole v1
vocabulary applies to arc endpoints with **no extra parameters and no extra
residuals** (design Decision 3b). The rejected alternative — free endpoint
points tied back by residuals — costs 7 parameters per arc and puts machinery
the user never wrote into every conflict report.

Angles are **degrees in the spec, radians in the parameter vector, and never
wrapped mid-solve**: the sweep is `theta2 - theta1` however many turns that
is, and normalization happens on output only. Wrapping a parameter is a
discontinuity in the Jacobian and is how an arc jumps the long way round
during a drag.

A dot in a name is the solver's namespace, not the caller's: virtual handles
(`arc1.end`) and compiled sub-entities (`slot1.arc_a`, an authored 3-point
arc's `a1.center`) live behind it, so a user entity containing a dot is a
`SketchError` rather than a silent rebinding. Sub-entities may be *referenced*
from a constraint; they may not be *declared*.

**Tangency has three residual forms, and the choice is not cosmetic.** When
the two curves do not otherwise meet, tangency is a distance:
`dist(centre, line) - r`, or `d(c1,c2) - (r1 +- r2)`. When they already meet at
a point, that form sits at an **extremum of the manifold the other constraints
cut out** — on that manifold `dist(centre, line) <= |centre - P| = r`, with
equality exactly at tangency — so its gradient falls into the span of the rows
that pin the junction. The Jacobian is **rank-deficient at the solution**, the
constraint reports itself redundant while doing real work, and `max_residual`
measures the *square* of the geometric error instead of the error.

**A junction is pinned by the JACOBIAN, not by any list.** This has been fixed
four times, and the first three fixes were each an enumeration the next
instance walked past: a list of entity handles (slice 6), a union-find over
`coincident` (slice 10), a table of constraint *kinds* that put a point on a
curve (`ON_CURVE_ARGS`, changelog 0142). The fourth was
`distance_x(p, a1.start, 0)` + `distance_y(p, a1.start, 0)` — a junction pinned
exactly as hard as a coincidence, on none of the lists.

`resolve_tangencies` replaces the enumeration with a criterion. Let `R` be
every residual row except the tangency rows being decided, and `x*` a
configuration `R` solves. A handle `h` is **held on** curve `c` when
`phi_c(h) == 0` at `x*` **and** `grad phi_c(h)` lies in the **row space of
`R`** (`phi` is the curve's own on-curve function: `|h - centre| - r`, or
`cross(h - a, u_line)`). Two curves share a junction when some handle is held
on both — which is exactly when the distance form sits at an extremum of the
manifold `R` cuts out. No constraint kind appears in it, so no new kind can
make it stale. The symbolic detector below still runs first, as a fast path,
and `ON_CURVE_ARGS` still drives it.

The measured history, all four instances:

- **structurally** — the line is built on `arc1.end` (a closed chain, a slot's
  side). `_shared_endpoint` detects it and uses the perpendicular form
  `(at - centre) . u_line` (`tangent_point_perp`). Measured in slice 6: a slot
  reported rank 1 of 5 and `dof 4` with its own name in `free_entities`; with
  the perpendicular form `dof 0`, and a 50-entity ring of arcs and lines went
  11.5 ms -> 6.1 ms warm (nfev 7 -> 4), `max_residual` 3.6e-8 -> 2.8e-14.
- **by a `coincident` constraint** — a junction *point* tied to the handle,
  which is what the GUI and most agents write. Measured in slice 10: on the
  GUI's line -> tangent-arc chain the singular values were
  `1.21e+1  2.45e+0  1.84e-16` against a `8.46e-9` rank tolerance — rank 2 of
  3, `dof 5` instead of 4, chip reading `over-constrained (1)` — and the
  arc-arc form is *exactly* dependent there (`4.70e-16`). With the direction
  form `t_a x t_b` (`tangent_dir`): `1.21e+1  1.73e+0  1.20e-01`, `dof 4`,
  nothing redundant.
- **by any on-curve constraint** — `point_on_circle`, `point_on_line`,
  `midpoint`, a `tangent`'s own `at`, or a coincidence chain reaching one.
  Measured in review: `point_on_circle(p, C) + tangent(L, C)` with `p = L.p1`
  gave J = [[0,1,0,0],[0,1,0,0]], svals `1.41  0.0`, rank 1 of 2, `dof 3`
  (true 2), `redundant: [tangent]` — and the same on the arc pair (1/2, dof 5)
  and the circle pair (2/3, dof 2). With a third constraint the solve reported
  `max_residual` 8.11e-11 / `ok: true` on a sketch whose true tangency error
  was **4.97e-05 mm**. With the direction form the residual is the *sine* of
  that error, so the ratio between them is the radius: measured 10.0, against
  6.1e+05 for the distance form.
  A circle has no handles, so its tangent at a pinned point comes from
  `_RadialTangent` — `rot90(unit(p - centre))`.
- **by any combination of rows that pins the offset** — review 2's
  `distance_x(p2, a1.start, 0)` + `distance_y(p2, a1.start, 0)`. Measured:
  svals `10.05  1.005  1.61e-16`, rank 2 of 3, `dof 7` (true 6),
  `redundant: [tangent]`. With the Jacobian criterion: `1.142  1.000  0.834`,
  rank 3 of 3, nothing redundant. The *value* half of the criterion is what
  keeps `distance_x(..., 5)` — the offset pinned to a point that is **not** on
  the arc — an ordinary tangency.

The three forms are the same geometry; only their linearizations differ. A
junction the sketch pins always has one of the two well-conditioned forms.

## Splines and slots (PRD-009 slice 6)

A **spline** is an ordered list of named `point` entities, so every point
constraint applies to its control points for free. Measured (slice 6 spike):
build123d's `Spline` interpolates that point list to **7.1e-15 mm**, far
inside the 1e-8 mm emission tolerance, so the solver's through-point model is
the emitted curve — `Bezier`, the documented fallback, misses by up to 9.8 mm
and was not needed. Its **end tangent** is a different matter: a free-end
`Spline` sits up to **44.6 deg** away from the first control-polygon leg, so
`tangent {a: "sp1.start", b: "ln4"}` holds on the emitted curve only if the
emitter passes `tangents=` (measured to pin the direction to 7.1e-15 deg while
still interpolating). The result payload carries `end_tangent` and the solved
directions for exactly that. **On-curve point constraints are out of scope.**

A **slot** compiles at ingestion into two arcs and two lines. Its two caps
share **one radius parameter** (equal-radius is structural, never a row) and
its four junctions are structural too (each side line is built on the caps'
handles), so it contributes exactly five rows: `radius = width/2` and four
tangencies. Every one of them carries the slot's own `con_index` and
`origin: "slot:<name>"`, and the slot's *caller-visible* index is `None` —
there is no entry of `spec["constraints"]` to point at, and a diagnostic never
blames a constraint the user did not write.

## The residual IR

Every constraint compiles to one or more `Residual` records carrying the spec
index that produced them, the parameter slots they can touch, their value
function `f` and their **analytic derivative** `df`. That buys three things:

- `df` makes the Jacobian one pass instead of `n_params + 1` finite-difference
  passes. Measured on a 50-segment staircase: 50.5 ms -> 0.5 ms warm.
  **A residual without a `df` reintroduces the O(n^2) cost, so `Residual`
  refuses to be constructed without one**, and every `df` is proven against a
  central difference of its own `f` in `tests/test_sketch_jacobian.py`.
  **That gate cannot tell you the residual is right**, and it did not: it is
  closed over `f`, so the internal circle-circle tangency computed
  `d - (r1 - r2)` instead of `d - |r1 - r2|` for two slices with a green
  derivative suite over it (review 2, C1/C15). The independent layer is
  `tests/test_sketch_semantics.py`, which asserts what each residual *means*
  against geometry it computes itself — including that `f` tracks the
  geometric error with the right sign and scale, which is the half a check at
  the solution cannot see.
- `con_index` lets a diagnostic name the constraint the caller actually wrote.
- `PointRef` indirection (a name -> value/gradient/param slots) is what will
  let arcs, ellipses and splines reuse this vocabulary through virtual handles
  (`arc1.end`) instead of multiplying constraint types.

Solve: `scipy.optimize.least_squares(..., jac=..., method="trf")`. `trf` is
used uniformly — MINPACK's `lm` requires `m >= n`, which an under-constrained
sketch violates, and the measurement shows the method is noise next to the
Jacobian. Residuals are scaled so lengths and unit-vector cross products mix
reasonably.

## Diagnostics

Every solve returns a `diagnostics` block (design Decision 6/7):

- `rank` comes from the SVD of the **row-scaled** Jacobian and
  **`dof = n_params - rank`**, never `n_params - n_residuals` (the row count
  reports a *negative* dof for any redundant constraint). Row scaling is not
  cosmetic either: scaling a row changes neither the row space nor the null
  space, but a relative singular-value threshold reads it as if it did, and one
  1e-9 mm line (a GUI double-click on the same spot) writes 1.4e+09 into the
  matrix through `_accum_dir`'s `1/n`. Measured: a pinned rectangle plus that
  one line reported rank 3 of 7, `dof 7`, `free_entities ['b','c','d','z','z2']`
  and `status: over_constrained` with **empty** `redundant` and `conflicting`
  sets — a block contradicting itself.
- **Where the greedy pass runs to completion, its count *is* the rank.** Greedy
  forward selection in declaration order is a rank-revealing factorization, so
  taking the rank from it is what makes `status`, `dof` and the blame sets
  agree by construction: `over_constrained` with an empty blame set is a bug,
  not a display problem, and `frontend/js/sketcher.js`'s chip branches on
  `status` for the same reason.
- `free_entities` is read off the null space, so an under-constrained sketch
  says *which* entities can still move rather than only how many DOF remain.
- The dependent set is found by **declaration-order greedy forward
  selection**, not by column-pivoted QR. Measured (design spec, Decision 6):
  pivoted QR blamed an innocent *original* `vertical` constraint in 2 of 3
  cases, because column pivoting selects by column norm — an artifact of
  residual scaling, not of intent. Greedy in declaration order was correct 4
  of 4, because it blames the *later* constraint, which is the one the user
  just added. `tests/test_sketch_diagnostics.py` pins both behaviours so a
  "simplification" back to QR fails loudly.
- A dependent row satisfied at the solution is **redundant**; a violated one
  is **conflicting**. `over_constrained` alone is *not* an error — only a
  non-empty `conflicting` set is (`core/tools_sketch.py` holds that contract).
- The greedy pass is bounded by `ANALYSIS_BUDGET_MS`; exhausting it yields
  `analysis_complete: false` with the two sets **omitted**. "We did not look"
  is never rendered as "nothing found".

## `initial`

`spec["initial"]` seeds the starting parameter vector — it **selects the
solution branch**, and it is not the speed mechanism (measured: the v1 solver
cost 20 ms seeded exactly at the solution and 51 ms seeded 0.4 mm away; the
Jacobian was always the cost). It can never change the spec: it cannot fix a
point, cannot override `fixed_r` and cannot introduce an entity. An unknown
name is an error; a stale or partial `initial` degrades to a cold start with
`warm_started: false` and an `initial_incomplete` warning.

It is **all-or-nothing**, so what counts as "all" has to be something a caller
can actually send: a **compiled** point (a 3-point arc's `<name>.center`) is
excluded from the coverage requirement. Requiring it made `initial` impossible
to satisfy for any sketch containing a 3-point arc — every frame reported
`initial_incomplete` and cold started, silently losing the branch stability the
seed exists for. It may still be seeded by name.

## `drag` (PRD-009 slice 8)

`spec["drag"] = {point, x, y, weight?}` compiles to a **weighted soft residual
block appended after the constraint rows**, and it is an **objective, not a
constraint**: excluded from `ok`, `max_residual`, `n_residuals`, `rank`, `dof`
and `diagnostics`, every one of which is computed over `[:n_res]`. Measured,
counting it makes every drag of a fully-constrained entity report `ok: false`
with `max_residual` 2.43 over a 48 mm drag — a verdict about the cursor.

The two halves are separate and both are needed. Seeding is `initial`, from the
**previous frame's solution**; the cursor enters only through the objective.
Measured on the mirror triangle (a, b pinned, c held by two distances, two
solutions at `(23.4375, +-18.7265)`): seeding c *at the cursor* flips the branch
the moment the cursor crosses the boundary, while the weak pull seeded from the
previous frame holds `+18.7265` through a sweep to `y = -30`.

The soft pull is a compromise, so a frame ends with one **constraint-only
re-solve seeded at the drag's answer** (`_settle`). Without it a
fully-constrained point lands `w^2` of the drag distance off its constraints
(measured 0.170 mm, `max_residual` 0.104) and `ok` would be false for the
honest reason that the coordinates really are off. With it the point returns to
where its constraints put it — which is what dragging a fully-constrained
entity should do — and it costs nothing when the drag moved only free DOF,
because the constraint rows are already satisfied there.

Diagnostics stay **off the drag path**: the greedy dependent-row pass is cached
against a hash of the compiled residual structure *and the constraint targets*,
and `spec["diagnostics"] in {"auto", "full", "cached"}` chooses. `auto`
recomputes except on a drag frame. **The cache holds the dependent-row set and
the rank it was found at, never the verdict**: the structure key excludes
coordinates (the GUI resends the whole spec every frame, so a coordinate key
would miss every time) while nonlinear rank depends on the configuration, so a
drag frame with two collapsed lines cached `rank 0 / dof 8 / over_constrained`
and the next ordinary solve of the same structure was served it (review 2,
C10). The rank is recomputed every frame and the cached set reused only if it
matches. `diagnostics_source` reports which frame's greedy pass you got, so a
cached measurement is never presented as a fresh one.

        This is the fourth time the tangency degeneracy has been fixed, and the
        first time the criterion is not an enumeration. The three previous
        detectors each answered "is this junction pinned" from a list — of
        entity handles (slice 6), of `coincident` unions (slice 10), of
        constraint *kinds* that put a point on a curve (changelog 0142) — and
        each list was complete until someone wrote the junction a way it did
        not cover. Review 2 wrote it with `distance_x(p, a1.start, 0)` +
        `distance_y(p, a1.start, 0)`: two rows that pin the junction exactly as
        hard as a coincidence and appear on no list at all.

        **The criterion.** Let `R` be every residual row *except* the tangency
        rows being decided, and let `x*` be a configuration those rows solve
        (the criterion is about the *solution*, so a rough seed must not decide
        it). A point handle `h` is **held on** curve `c` when both of these
        hold at `x*`:

        1. `phi_c(h) = 0` — `h` is on `c` there (`phi` is the curve's own
           on-curve function: `|h - centre| - r`, or `cross(h - a, u_line)`);
        2. `grad phi_c(h)` lies in the **row space of R** — the other rows
           determine it, so it cannot move off the curve without breaking one
           of them.

        The two curves share a junction when some handle is held on both, and
        that is exactly the condition under which the distance form sits at an
        extremum of the manifold `R` cuts out (its gradient is then a
        combination of R's rows, so it adds no rank and its value is the
        *square* of the geometric error). No constraint kind appears anywhere
        in it, so a new kind cannot make it stale: any combination of rows that
        removes both degrees of freedom of the junction — however spelled —
        puts `grad phi` in the row space, because the offset it would have to
        move along is in R's null space.

        Two things it deliberately does **not** claim:

        - **Value, not just rank.** `distance_x(p, a1.start, 5)` pins the
          offset just as firmly, to a point that is *not* on the arc. That is
          an ordinary tangency, and condition (1) is what keeps it one.
        - **Ellipses and splines are out**, and that is a coverage gap, not a
          proof. Neither has a closed-form on-curve function here, so
          `_on_curve_residual` returns None for them and only the symbolic
          detector can find a junction on one. 0142 and 0143 both wrote that
          the elliptical fallback is "already a pair of direction residuals",
          which is false either way round (measured 0144): against a line it
          compiles `point_on_line(P(t))` + `tangent_dir`, and against a circle
          or arc `point_on_circle(P(t))` + `tangent_point_perp` — two *length*
          residuals and no direction row at all. What actually keeps it out of
          this class is the auxiliary anomaly, which makes the touch point a
          free parameter instead of a point the sketch pins. Ellipse-to-ellipse
          is refused outright.

        **Where `x*` comes from, and why not a projection.** 0143 manufactured
        `x*` by running `least_squares` on `R` alone from the caller's seed,
        under an evaluation budget. That was wrong three ways, all measured
        (0144): it read `fit.x` without reading `fit.status`, so a projection
        that stopped 76 mm short was used as if it were a solution and the
        junction was silently missed; the miss was a function of *seed
        distance*, so the same sketch drawn 275 mm off its junction compiled a
        different residual than one drawn 250 mm off; and it ran on every
        compile, i.e. on every drag frame, for 109 ms of it when the budget was
        exhausted.

        The solver already produces a configuration that solves `R` — the
        solution. So: compile the provisional (distance) form, **solve**, and
        ask the criterion there. There is no projection, no evaluation budget
        and no seed sensitivity; `x*` satisfies `R` by construction or the
        question is not asked at all. A junction that is found costs one extra
        solve, started from a configuration that is already a solution rather
        than from whatever the caller drew — which is also what keeps the
        direction residual off its own stationary point (see below).

        And when `R` cannot be solved, **nothing is assumed**: the tangency
        keeps the provisional form and the result carries a
        `tangency_junction_undecided` warning naming the constraint. The one
        thing this pass must never do is quietly compile the degenerate form.

        The symbolic detector runs first and is unchanged, so every sketch it
        already resolved costs nothing here (measured: the slot ring and the
        50-segment staircase never reach this pass). Neither does a sketch
        whose seed already solves `R` — a drag frame warm-started from the
        previous frame — because that seed *is* an `x*`.

        `<ellipse>.tangency` and the condition is written where it *is*
        closed-form — the touch point lies on the other curve, and the two
        tangents agree there:

        - against a line: `point_on_line(P(t))` + `t_ellipse(t) x u_line`;
        - against a circle or arc: `|P(t) - centre| = r` +
          `(P(t) - centre) . t_ellipse(t) = 0` (the centre lies on the
          ellipse's normal).

        Net one degree of freedom removed, as a tangency should be: +1
        parameter, +2 rows. The parameter is **seeded geometrically** — the
        anomaly of the closest point on the ellipse to the other curve, found
        by a 72-sample scan of the starting geometry plus a local refinement.

        Measured (slice 11 spike, 20 randomized starts per configuration; the
        plan's ship/no-ship gate was 90%): **20/20 for both pairings**,
        geometric tangency error p50 9.25e-13 mm (line) and 1.32e-10 mm
        (circle), max 9.1e-10 — measured as the true minimum distance from the
        other curve to the ellipse, not from the residual.
        `tests/test_sketch_ellipses.py` re-runs exactly those starts.

        The geometric seed is worth its microseconds but is **not** what makes
        it feasible: from a fixed `t=0` seed both configurations still solve
        20/20, and from a uniformly random anomaly 20/20 and 19/20. Cost: nfev
        p50 48 (line) and 120 (circle), solve p50 3.8 ms and 7.8 ms — a
        curve-ellipse tangency is the most expensive constraint in the
        vocabulary, and on a drag path it is the one to watch.

        When the two curves already meet at a junction the sketch pins, there
