"""macOS confinement and quotas: the seatbelt profile and the rlimit tier.

The backend half of :mod:`agentcad.kernel.sandbox` for ``sys.platform ==
"darwin"``. Two jobs:

* **Confinement** — wrap the worker's argv in ``/usr/bin/sandbox-exec -p
  <profile>``. The profile is the v3 one, moved here unchanged: deny by
  default, global read (the ``local`` posture, which is the only posture
  macOS has), writes only inside the roots the client granted, no network.
* **Quotas** — macOS can enforce far less than Linux. ``RLIMIT_AS``/``DATA``/
  ``RSS`` are ``EINVAL`` on Darwin and ``RLIMIT_CPU`` is lifetime-cumulative
  (a script with a ``SIGXCPU`` handler ran 100 s past its hard limit in the
  spike), so the memory cap is the supervisor's and the only rlimit worth
  emitting is ``RLIMIT_NPROC``. It is per-*uid*, not per-process: a fixed 32
  killed the worker during ``import build123d``, so the payload is the live
  uid process count — measured afresh at **every** spawn (``MacBackend.
  refresh``) — plus the configured headroom **times the pool size**, which is
  what stops one pool slot spending the budget the next one needs.

The rlimits travel to the child as ``AGENTCAD_CONFINE`` (JSON) and are applied
by the worker's own preamble — no ``preexec_fn`` anywhere, because CPython
documents it as unsafe in a threaded parent and the server is threaded. In
this slice nothing reads the variable yet; the preamble arrives with the
Linux backend.

Deliberately importable from server code and from any OS (the ``ctypes``
calls are lazy): no ``OCP``/build123d, and no macOS symbol touched at import.
