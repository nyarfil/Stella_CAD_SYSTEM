"""ERROR DOCTOR — catalog of real OCCT / build123d 0.11.1 failure signatures.

Every entry was actually triggered on build123d 0.11.1 / OCP 7.8.x (macOS
arm64); see test_error_doctor.py which triggers each one and proves the regex
matches.

Usage (worker-side, agentcad/kernel/worker.py):

    from agentcad.toolkit.error_doctor import diagnose
    try:
        exec_user_script()
    except Exception as e:
        entry = diagnose(e)          # or diagnose_text(type_name, msg, tb)
        details["hint"] = entry and f"{entry['diagnosis']} Fix: {entry['fix']}"

Each entry:
    id        - stable slug for telemetry
    regex     - matched (re.search) against "<ExcType>: <message>\\n<traceback>"
                (?s) multi-line lookaheads used where message alone is ambiguous
    diagnosis - plain-language what-went-wrong
    fix       - concrete next action for the agent
Order matters: first match wins; specific entries precede generic ones.
