"""Confinement and quotas for kernel workers: the platform-independent seam.

Part scripts execute arbitrary Python inside the worker subprocess, so every
worker is spawned under two separate promises:

* **confinement** — what the process may reach: writes only inside the roots
  the client granted, no network, no signals at anything but itself. On macOS
  that is the seatbelt profile (``sandbox_macos``); on Linux it is the worker
  confining *itself* with Landlock and seccomp before it imports build123d
  (``sandbox_linux`` -> ``_preamble`` -> ``_confine``). On Windows the worker
  is started inside an **AppContainer** — a package SID with no capabilities,
  the roots granted by ``icacls``, spawned through ``CreateProcessW`` because
  ``subprocess`` cannot pass a lowbox token (``sandbox_windows``, PRD-006b) —
  and capped by a job object.
* **quotas** — how much of the machine it may take (``quotas.py``). These are
  *tiers*: a knob may be enforced by a cgroup, an rlimit, a job object or the
  parent's supervisor loop, and health names the tier in effect rather than
  promising one.

The two are independent. ``AGENTCAD_NO_SANDBOX=1`` (env, wins) or
``{"sandbox": false}`` in the user config file opts out of **confinement**;
the quotas still apply, because a runaway script may not take the machine
down whether or not the operator trusts it with the filesystem.

:func:`plan` is the entry point: it creates the worker's **private temp dir**,
builds the child's environment, picks the platform backend and returns a
:class:`SandboxPlan` the client spawns from. Deliberately importable from
server code: no ``OCP``/build123d imports here.

Honesty (design spec, Decision 8): ``confinement.status`` on a plan is what
this process *intends* to apply. The client downgrades it from the worker's
own ping report — a preamble that failed is ``off`` with a warning, never
``active`` by intent.
