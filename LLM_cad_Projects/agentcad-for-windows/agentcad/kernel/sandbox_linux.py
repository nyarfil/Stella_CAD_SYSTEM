"""Linux confinement and quotas: the payload the worker confines itself with.

The backend half of :mod:`agentcad.kernel.sandbox` for ``sys.platform ==
"linux"``. Unlike macOS there is nothing to wrap the argv in — the argv comes
back unchanged — because Linux confinement is **in-process**: this module
computes the roots and writes them into ``AGENTCAD_CONFINE``, and the worker's
own preamble (``_preamble`` -> ``_confine``) applies Landlock and seccomp to
itself before it imports build123d. That is what makes it work in the shipped
container at all: ``bwrap`` needs ``unshare``, which Docker's default seccomp
profile denies, and the Dockerfile refuses to hand out ``SYS_ADMIN`` to get it
(design spec, Decision 1).

Two read postures (Decision 2):

* ``local`` — read anywhere (``/``), the historical stance, matching the
  seatbelt's documented posture. Writes are still only the granted roots.
* ``hosted`` — an allow-list, so a member's part script can no longer read
  ``<state-dir>/secret.key`` and forge a session. The same uid runs the server
  and the worker, so DAC cannot express this; Landlock can.

Quotas come in three tiers, and the mechanism string names only the ones this
client actually installed (Decision 3):

* ``cgroup`` — :class:`CgroupTier`, opt-in **by delegation**: a directory the
  operator handed us (``AGENTCAD_CGROUP_DIR=<path>``) or, with an explicit
  ``=auto``, a genuinely delegated own cgroup. Unset means the tier is not
  probed at all. It is the only tier that OOM-kills, and the only one that can
  be missing without anything being wrong.
* ``rlimit`` — ``RLIMIT_AS``/``RLIMIT_NPROC``, applied by the worker to itself
  from the payload. A breach here is a recoverable ``MemoryError`` or
  ``BlockingIOError`` *inside the script*, with a line number, and the warm
  worker survives — the single best property of the tier.
* ``supervisor`` — the parent sampling ``/proc/<pid>/statm``
  (:meth:`LinuxBackend.rss_bytes`) in its request loop.

Deliberately importable from server code and from any OS (every syscall is
lazy, and :func:`landlock_abi` answers ``0`` off Linux): no ``OCP``/build123d.
