"""Degenerate-boolean detection for solid intersections (OCCT 7.9).

Underscore-prefixed, so ``worker._load_handler_packs`` skips it during pack
discovery — this is a shared helper, not a handler pack (the ``_pdf.py``
precedent).

**The measured root cause.** ``BRepAlgoAPI_Common`` (build123d's ``&``) is not
reliable when *both* operands carry G1-tangent face junctions — a cylinder
flowing into a torus flowing into a cylinder, i.e. any swept solid with a
filleted centre line. The failure is silent: ``IsDone()`` is ``True``, no
error is raised, and this OCP build exposes no ``HasErrors()``. What comes
back is an **empty** shape, a **whole-operand** shape, or (rarely) a shape
whose ``volume`` is **negative**. Measured on the bench's coolant elbow
(``fix_005``, a Ø24×3 annulus swept along a 24 mm-radius right-angle bend,
21 711.685 mm3): two *coincident* copies of that solid — the same geometry,
one built from the script and one round-tripped through STEP — intersect to
**nothing**, where the truth is the whole 21 711.685 mm3. The STEP round trip
is *not* the trigger (STEP ⊗ STEP is degenerate too — changelog 0282:214-223
measured that correctly); differing operand provenance merely stops OCCT
taking the "same shape" shortcut that hid the bug. The same lie shows up on
shifted pairs, where it is *order-dependent*: an earlier boolean in the same
process changes whether the next one answers truthfully.

No healing recipe fixes it. Fuzzy booleans at every tolerance, ``ShapeFix``,
``UnifySameDomain``, sewing, ``Copy``, ``Glue`` and OBB alignment were all
probed and all fail. Reported upstream with a minimal reproduction as
https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/1496 (OCCT 7.9.3; specific to
``BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell`` output — an equivalent primitives-built fuse
does not reproduce). So the answer is **detection and honest degradation**,
never a silent zero: the bench turns a degenerate pair into a ``status:
"error"`` subscore (excluded, FR7) and the product path reports the pair as
interfering with ``degenerate: true`` (fail-closed).

**How the detector works.** A *positive* volume is trusted. A *negative* one
is impossible and is reported degenerate outright (the old ``max(v, 0.0)``
clamp laundered exactly this into a clean zero). An *empty* result is the
interesting case: the recheck runs only when the two AABBs overlap by at least
:data:`SUSPECT_OVERLAP_FRACTION` of the smaller box. Then :func:`_disagrees`
crops one operand to each octant of the overlap box and booleans the cropped
pieces against the other operand — by more than the caller's own
``min_volume``, so a tangential-contact sliver is not mistaken for evidence.
The crop is the point: it cuts *through* the tangent junctions, so each piece
is a simpler operand that OCCT handles correctly. If any piece intersects, the
two computations disagree — the whole-solid boolean lied.

**How often that costs anything.** For whole-part pairs, rarely: a near-miss
has little AABB overlap and never reaches the recheck. But
``worker.pairwise_interference`` also calls this from its *crop* branch, where
one operand has already been cut down to the overlap box — a piece whose AABB
sits entirely inside the other solid's, i.e. an overlap fraction of ~1.0. Down
that branch the recheck fires on essentially **every** empty result, and that
branch is the fastener path, the one with the highest pair cardinality. Forcing
:func:`_disagrees` to answer ``True`` visibly drops the interference subscore of
the bench's ``asm_001_thrust_chamber`` and ``asm_003_bolted_joint`` references,
which is how we know it runs there. Measured, the cost is inside run-to-run
noise on those references — but ``handlers/motion.py`` calls
``pairwise_interference`` once **per sweep sample**, so whatever it costs is
multiplied by the sample count, and that has not been measured.

The recheck is a **detector only, never the measurement**: its octant sum is
not a valid intersection volume (the crops overlap on their shared faces and a
piece may itself be booleaned wrong), so a detected pair reports ``0.0`` plus
the ``degenerate`` flag and lets the caller decide how to fail.

**Residual blind spots.** This narrows the hole; it does not close it. Three
false negatives remain, and none of them should be read as covered:

1. A degenerate *plausible-positive* result — OCCT returning some non-zero
   volume that is simply wrong — is not detected at all. Finding it would mean
   re-deriving every intersection by an independent method, which costs more
   than the measurement it checks. The same order-dependence that produces the
   empty answers produces these: two back-to-back evaluations of the *same*
   operand pair in one process have been observed answering "empty" and
   "924.22 mm3".
2. :data:`SUSPECT_OVERLAP_FRACTION` is a **coverage cliff, not only a cost
   gate**. A degenerate pair whose AABBs overlap by less than half the smaller
   box is banked clean exactly as before. The bench elbow pair shifted 40 mm in
   Z already sits at 0.44 — one shift away from the gate — so this is not a
   remote corner.
3. :func:`_disagrees` is one subdivision level of one operand, evaluated by the
   *same* unreliable kernel. It can answer "no disagreement" on a pair that is
   genuinely degenerate, and there is no second opinion behind it.
