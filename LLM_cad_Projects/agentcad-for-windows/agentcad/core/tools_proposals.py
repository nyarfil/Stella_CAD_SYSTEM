"""Tool pack: change proposals — a CAD pull request over PRD-001's branches.

Installs the seams the feature needs — ``service.proposals``
(:class:`~agentcad.core.proposals.ProposalManager`), ``service.packets``
(:class:`~agentcad.core.packet.PacketBuilder`) and ``service.gate_providers``,
the empty list PRD-003 (specs) and PRD-004 (checks) append their own gates to —
and exposes the lifecycle as tools. Handlers are thin delegations; every
workflow rule lives in ``proposals.py`` and every measurement in ``packet.py``.

The whole pack self-disables when git is not on PATH — no tools, no seams — so
the product degrades to today's linear history rather than offering an agent a
tool that cannot run (the FEM-pack precedent, shared with ``tools_versioning``).

**Load order.** ``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks ``pkgutil.iter_modules``
alphabetically, so this module is imported *before* ``tools_versioning``:
``service.branches`` and ``service.merges`` do not exist yet when ``register()``
runs. The manager therefore reaches both lazily, inside each call, and installs
its ``branch_delete`` guard on first use (and from ``routes_proposals``, the
first point at which ``service.branches`` is guaranteed to exist) rather than
here.

Convention agents must not get backwards, repeated in the descriptions below:
**old = the target branch** (ours, what you merge into), **new = the source**
(theirs, the proposed work), exactly like ``git merge <source>``.
