"""Per-project turn locks, per-part soft claims, and client identity plumbing.

A turn lock is advisory-but-enforced: any client may acquire the turn on a
project; while it is held, persistent writes by *other* clients are rejected
with a ConflictError naming the holder, until release or TTL expiry. With no
lock held, nothing changes — every write works exactly as before.

A **claim** (PRD-008, design Decision 14) is the finer-grained sibling: it
names one *part*, it is taken implicitly by editing rather than explicitly by
asking, and it is **human-vs-human only**. Three rules, in this order, on every
persistent write:

1. the turn lock decides first, with its existing code path, message and
   details (AC6's regression gate is that ``tests/test_locks.py`` passes
   unmodified);
2. the client holding the turn is **never** claim-checked (FR12);
3. a part claimed by a *different* client conflicts unless the caller is an
   agent. If an agent's write were blocked by a human's open editor, the
   product's flagship loop — human pins a comment on a face, agent fixes it and
   replies — would 409 on the agent's very first write. The exemption runs that
   way and no other: an agent also never *takes* a claim (``acquire`` refuses a
   non-human holder), because a claim an agent held would be a claim no human
   could conflict with, and one agent write would then switch off the
   human-vs-human protection for 90 s. Agents are governed by turns; claims
   stop two humans clobbering each other.

Identity travels on a ContextVar so it flows naturally through the service
layer regardless of entry point (HTTP middleware sets it per request from the
``X-Agent-Id`` header; the chat engine sets it to ``"chat"`` inside its tool
executor; plain library use defaults to ``"local"``). The *part* a write names
travels the same way, through :func:`write_scope`, for a reason worth stating:
``ProjectStore.write_guard`` is ``Callable[[str], None]``, and widening it to
carry a part would mean editing ``service.py``'s default lambda,
``tools_versioning.install_write_guard`` and every guard any test installs. A
contextvar reaches the guard without changing that seam, and every guard that
ignores it behaves byte-identically.
