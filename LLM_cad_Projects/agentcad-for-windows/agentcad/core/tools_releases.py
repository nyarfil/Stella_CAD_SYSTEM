"""Tool pack: releases — the revision record + state machine over a project's
manifest (PRD-015 FR6-8).

Thin delegations; every rule lives in ``core/releases.py``. The pack
self-disables when git is not on PATH — a release opens a PRD-002 proposal, and
proposals need branches — so an agent never sees ``release_start`` on a project
that cannot run it (the ``tools_proposals`` / ``tools_versioning`` precedent).

**Load order.** ``tools._load_tool_packs`` walks ``pkgutil.iter_modules``
alphabetically, so this module registers *after* ``tools_proposals`` (which
resets ``service.gate_providers = []`` and installs ``service.proposals``) — the
seam ``release_start`` reaches. This pack registers **no gate provider** of its
own: the release checks are composed inline in ``release_start`` from the
proposal's already-evaluated specs/checks gates, not appended to
``gate_providers`` (which would run against *every* proposal). ``release_finalize``
— the tag/finalize path (slice 4, FR9/FR12) — tags ``release/<rev>``, registers
the tag referrer and transitions the record to ``released``; it too is git +
manifest only, with no gate provider and no kernel call.
