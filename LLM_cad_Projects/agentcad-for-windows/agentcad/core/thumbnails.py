"""Content-addressed part and assembly thumbnails (PRD-027 FR4).

Three claims hold this module together, and every function here exists to keep
one of them true:

1. **A thumbnail is derived data keyed by the build's cache key.** It lives at
   ``.cache/<cache_key>.thumb.png`` beside the mesh it was rendered from. The
   key already hashes script + params + density + tolerance, so a script edit
   refreshes the thumbnail *by construction* — there is no invalidation path to
   get wrong, and two parts that build to one key share one file. ``.thumb.png``
   is in ``project._TRIMMABLE``, so the janitor sweeps a trimmed key's thumb
   with its mesh.
2. **Nothing here ever reaches the kernel.** Not ``ensure_mesh``, not
   ``_ensure_built``, not ``get_assembly``. A thumbnail is rendered from a mesh
   that is *already on disk* or it is not rendered at all — which is what makes
   a dashboard of twenty projects a directory walk rather than twenty builds.
   It does not even call ``service._resolved_instances``, which is a seam
   `tools_structure` rebinds onto `mates.resolve_project`; `_instances` below
   says exactly which transforms that costs us and why it is the right trade.
3. **It is never on the rebuild path.** :class:`ThumbnailWarmer` is a
   *pre-warm*: a daemon thread that reacts to ``rebuild_finished`` after the
   fact. Every route renders on demand anyway (≈5–20 ms at 192²), so a service
   with the warmer off answers identically, only colder.

The rasterizer is ``core/render.py`` — numpy + stdlib PNG, no OCP — so this
module is importable in the server process, which is where both the routes and
the warmer thread run.

    outside any request, so if it subscribed through the tenant-filtering
    wrapper (``tenancy_wiring._install_bus``) its queue would bind the *empty*
    tenant and then drop every tenanted ``rebuild_finished`` on a hosted
    instance with orgs — the pre-warm would be silently dead there. So it
    subscribes through the wrapper's ``_agentcad_inner`` seam, which is the
    unfiltered bus, and carries **each event's own** ``tenant`` into a
    :func:`tenancy.tenant_scope` around that event's render. It therefore reads
    exactly one workspace's cache per render, the one that published the event,
    and never crosses tenants. No change to ``tenancy_wiring`` is needed: the
    seam it exposes for ``uninstall`` is the same one used here.

    The pending set is bounded and **coalesced by ``(project, key)``**; when it
    is full the **oldest** entry is dropped, because freshness catches up on the
    next read while a stale backlog never would. The event's tenant rides as the
    map's *value* so the coalescing key is unchanged (and so is
    ``pending()``); two tenants that hash to one ``(project, key)`` — an
    identical script and params in two orgs — coalesce to one warm, and the
    loser is a cold first read, never a cross-tenant write. A render failure is
    counted and printed to stderr — never raised: a thumbnail that did not
    appear must not be able to take a build path or a server thread with it.
