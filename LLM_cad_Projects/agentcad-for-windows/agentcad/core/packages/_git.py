"""The git runner for package indexes — and why it is **not** `history._run`.

`AGENTS.md` says every git call goes through `ProjectHistory._run`, never a
raw `subprocess`. That rule is a statement about **the project history
repository**, and `_run` is built for exactly that:

* it hard-codes ``--git-dir <project>/.history --work-tree <project>``;
* its timeout is **10 s**;
* it redirects ``HOME`` and ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME`` into ``.history`` and sets
  ``GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM=1``, so a user's ``~/.gitconfig`` (hooks, gpg signing,
  a rewritten url) cannot interfere.

Every one of those is **wrong** for fetching a remote index. There is no work
tree — the checkout *is* the tree. A clone routinely exceeds 10 s. And
redirecting ``HOME`` disables the credential helper that a private index
repository needs, which is the one case a package registry has to serve well.

So this is a second, small runner with its own rules, and this docstring
exists so nobody "fixes" it back:

* **Fixed argv, never a shell.** ``shell=True`` is not used and no argument is
  interpolated into a string.
* **120 s timeout**, configurable per call.
* ``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT=0`` and ``GIT_ASKPASS=""`` so a server never blocks on
  a password prompt. ``GIT_SSH_COMMAND`` gains ``BatchMode=yes`` **only when
  the caller has not set one**, because ``GIT_TERMINAL_PROMPT`` does not cover
  ssh and a 120 s block on a passphrase prompt is the exact failure it exists
  to prevent (an ssh-agent key still works).
* **``HOME`` is not redirected**, and neither is ``XDG_CONFIG_HOME``.
* The URL is **validated**: ``https://``, ``ssh://``, ``git@host:path``,
  ``file://`` or an absolute path — never starting with ``-`` (git would read
  it as an option), **never with an ssh host that starts with ``-``** (git
  passes the host on to ssh, where ``-oProxyCommand=…`` is an option and the
  ``--`` separator protects git's argv and not ssh's), and never carrying a
  shell metacharacter. Fixed argv makes a metacharacter inert; it is still
  refused, because defence that only works when the *other* defence works is
  not defence. The **ref** is checked the same way, for the same reason: it
  reaches ``--branch`` before the ``--``.
