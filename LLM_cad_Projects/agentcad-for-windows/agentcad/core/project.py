        Returns ``{"removed": [ids], "errors": {id: payload},
        "instances_removed": {part_id: [instance ids]}}`` — the instances keyed
        by the part that took them, because that is what a bulk row reports
        back to the person who pressed the button. Per-item validity, partial
        success: an
        unknown id and a part an assembly still uses are *rows*, not
        exceptions, so one bad id in a fifty-part selection does not throw the
        other forty-nine away. The single-part `remove_part` still raises —
        it has one item, and a caller with one item wants the exception.

        The single `save_manifest` is the point: one write is one
        `project_changed` publish is one history snapshot is **one undo step**
        (design ruling 4). Scripts are unlinked **after** it, so a crash
        between the two leaves orphaned files rather than manifest entries
        pointing at nothing.

        ``force`` extends the write to the assembly: every instance of a
        removed part is dropped in the same manifest RMW (a pattern instance
        names its part the same way; a sub-assembly instance carries
        ``part: ""`` and can never match).

        **A dropped instance that something still points at is refused, not
        written.** `set_instances` rejects a dangling ``mate.to_instance`` on
        write — "so removing an anchor instance can't leave the whole assembly
        unreadable" — and `set_assembly_interface` makes the same referential
        check. Writing the manifest directly here would go around both and
        leave a project whose next gizmo drag is a `ValidationError`. So the
        drop set is checked against the *survivors* to a fixpoint (dropping
        one part's instances can only ever create blockers, never clear them),
        and a part whose instances are still referenced becomes a
        `conflict_error` row naming what holds it in ``details.referenced_by``.

        **Claims (PRD-008) are deliberately not consulted per part.** A part
        removal is a whole-manifest write, and `presence.py`'s guard documents
        exactly that case: "a whole-manifest write (add/remove part, assembly,
        materials, restore, undo) is turn-locked ONLY, by design — a claim is
        a part claim". `remove_part` takes no `write_scope`; neither does
        this, so bulk delete is not stricter than the single delete it
        mirrors. The metadata ops (`update_parts_meta`) are the ones a claim
        guards, because those are genuinely per-part writes.

        **PRECONDITION** — like `update_parts_meta`, this is an unserialized
        read-modify-write. The caller holds
        ``manifest_scope(store, proj)`` and ``service._lock``, outer to inner.

        Scoped like `write_script` and `update_part_entry`: the guard that
        `save_manifest` calls sees the part this write is about, so a PRD-008
        claim on it refuses.

        **PRECONDITION — the caller MUST serialize this call**, exactly as
        `update_parts_meta` documents. `write_scope` is the *claim* check, not
        a mutex: this is an unserialized read-modify-write (manifest read →
        guard → `save_manifest`), so a concurrent `set_params`,
        `update_part_entry` or bulk op landing inside the window is silently
        lost — both callers are told "ok" and one of the two writes is gone.
        The caller holds::

            with manifest_scope(service.store, proj), service._lock:
                service.store.update_part_meta(proj, part_id, ...)

        Both locks, outer-to-inner in that order (the `update_parts_meta`
        docstring argues the order at length, and the reason this method does
        not take `manifest_scope` itself is the same one: doing so would
        invert the house acquisition order and deadlock against
        `tools_configs.set_instance_config`). `tools_navigation.set_part_meta`
        is the one caller and takes both.

        ``edits`` maps part id -> ``{"folder": str|None, "tags": list|None,

        means "set it" (its ``None`` is a real value, root), while ``tags``
        and ``material`` treat ``None`` as "leave alone".

        The single `save_manifest` is the point of the method, not an
        optimization: one manifest write is one `project_changed` publish is
        one history snapshot is **one undo step** (design ruling 4). A bulk
        op built out of N `update_part_meta` calls would cost the user N
        presses of Cmd+Z to take back one gesture.

        Nothing is mutated until everything validates, and the write guard is
        invoked once per part id **inside that part's `write_scope`** before
        the first mutation — so a part another human holds refuses the whole
        bulk with the usual `ConflictError` (ruling 5) rather than leaving
        half of it applied.

        **PRECONDITION — the caller MUST serialize this call.** This is an
        UNSERIALIZED read-modify-write with a deliberately wide window: the
        manifest is read at the top, then N write-guard calls run (each one a
        branch-checkout check and a turn-lock check, i.e. real I/O), and only
        then is the mutated manifest saved. A concurrent `set_params`,
        `update_part_entry` or `set_instances` on the same project inside that
        window is **silently lost** — the last save wins and the loser was told
        it succeeded. The store cannot close this itself, so the caller holds::

            with manifest_scope(service.store, proj), service._lock:
                service.store.update_parts_meta(proj, edits)

        Both locks, outer-to-inner in exactly that order — `manifest_scope`
        (from `packages/manager.py`) against the configuration tools and the
        package manager, `service._lock` against `service.update_part` /
        `set_params` / `set_assembly`. It is the order
        `tools_configs.set_instance_config` already documents and takes; both
        are reentrant.

        **Why this method does not take `manifest_scope` itself:** because the
        caller holds `service._lock` around it (that is the service layer's
        serialization primitive for a manifest RMW — `service.update_part` is
        the precedent), acquiring `manifest_scope` *inside* here would make the
        acquisition order `service._lock` → `manifest_scope`, the exact inverse
        of the house order above. Two threads — one entering through
        `set_instance_config`, one through the bulk op — would then hold one
        lock each and wait for the other. A lock taken at the wrong level is
        worse than no lock, so it is the caller's, named here instead. (The
        layering says the same thing: `core/project.py` is the bottom of the
        import graph, and pulling `packages.manager` — and with it `cache`,
        `indexes`, `lockfile`, `_git` — into the store to reach one RLock
        inverts the dependency as well as the locks.)

        **OBLIGATION — `material` is not just a field.** It feeds
        `_cache_key` (via `service.material_density`), so a caller that changes
        one must, per affected part, publish `project_changed` and then call
        `service.rebuild_after_write(proj, part_id)` — the `service.update_part`
        precedent. Writing it here without that leaves the part's cached mesh,
        its `_status` entry and its mass metrics computed against the OLD
        density, and nothing will correct them until something else happens to
        invalidate the key. `folder`/`tags` carry no such obligation: they
        reach no cache key and no geometry request.

        rebuild for a file that was on disk. A file younger than this is
        somebody's, whether or not this process remembers whose.

        that lands immediately after another one measures the older number and
        can decline to trim work that has since arrived. That is a bounded

        check from walking three directory trees on every request, and the next

        The staging name carries a random suffix, and that is the whole of the
        fix recorded in changelog 0181: it used to be the fixed
        ``<name>.tmp``, so two concurrent writers opened the **same** staging
        file, interleaved their bytes into it, and then each `os.replace`d the
        mixture into place. `os.replace` was atomic the whole time — the file
        being replaced *from* was the shared one. The failure was not a lost
        update but a **corrupt `project.json`** ("Extra data" out of
        `json.loads`), which is the difference between losing one write and
        losing the project.

        The `.staging-<rand>` idiom is `cache.install`'s and
        `LocalIndex.publish`'s, for the same reason and now spelled the same
        way. Callers that need mutual exclusion still need it — this makes a
        concurrent write lose, never corrupt.
