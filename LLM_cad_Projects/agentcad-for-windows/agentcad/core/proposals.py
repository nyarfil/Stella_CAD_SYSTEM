"""Change proposals: the durable object, its lifecycle, audit and gates.

A proposal is a *CAD pull request*: a branch pair (``source`` -> ``target``),
an intent, an attributed lifecycle and a gate in front of PRD-001's merge. This
module is the whole of that workflow and nothing else — it writes files, reads
branch heads, evaluates gates, and never builds or renders. The merge itself is
``MergeOrchestrator``'s, called unchanged once the gates are green
(:meth:`ProposalManager.merge`); the review packet is slice 4.

**Where the state lives.** ``<project>/.history/agentcad/proposals/``, beside
PRD-001's ``config.json``/``checkouts.json``/``tags.json``/``merge.json``, and
therefore inside GIT_DIR: a proposal is *about* a branch pair, so it must be
visible from every branch and belong to none, and ``project_restore`` (which is
``git checkout <commit> -- .`` in a working tree) structurally cannot rewind it
(FR3). Paths always come from ``store.canonical_path_of`` — never ``path_of``,
which follows the caller's branch.

```
.history/agentcad/proposals/
  index.json     {"next_id": 4, "proposals": [summary, …]}   (a CACHE)
  next_id        4        (the id high-water mark — NOT a cache)
  policy.json    {"approvals_required": 1, "self_approve": false}  (optional)
  3/proposal.json · audit.jsonl · packet.json · renders/ · diff/
```

**Durability rules.** ``proposal.json``/``index.json`` are written with
``ProjectStore._atomic_write``; ``audit.jsonl`` is deliberately *appended* and
never rewritten (FR14 makes it append-only — a read-modify-replace cycle would
both lose that property and risk truncating the log on a crash). ``index.json``
is rebuilt from the per-proposal directories whenever it is missing or
unparseable, so it is never the source of truth; ids are decimal strings
allocated from ``next_id``, which only ever increments — a directory deleted by
hand does not hand its id to the next proposal. The high-water mark therefore
lives in its own one-line ``next_id`` file, not only in the rebuildable index:
rebuilding from the directories alone would forget the id of a proposal that
was deleted, and hand it out again.

**Attribution.** The actor is ``locks.current_client_id()`` — the identity turn
locks and branch checkouts already key on — and :func:`actor_kind` derives
human vs agent from it. That is bookkeeping, not authentication (the header is
unvalidated until PRD-005).

**Git.** Branch names resolve through ``history.resolve_branch``, never
``resolve_ref``: a tag named like a branch must not answer for it (PRD-001 X1).
``service.branches`` is read inside methods, never in ``__init__`` — the tool
pack that installs this manager is imported *before* ``tools_versioning``.

    the audit trail must say so. This is a deliberate judgement call, not a
    heuristic to extend: the browser is the only *unauthenticated* surface a
    human drives directly.

    PRD-005a is the change this docstring used to promise ("PRD-005 replaces it
    with the authenticated principal's class, with no schema change"). In
    hosted mode the identity is a composed principal — ``user:nikita`` or
    ``user:nikita/browser:7f3a1b2c`` for a person, ``agent:ci`` for a bearer
    token — and neither starts with ``browser:``. Without the two prefix tests
    below, **every signed-in human would classify as an agent**, and that is
    not cosmetic: :meth:`ClaimRegistry.acquire` returns ``None`` for a
    non-human holder, so no hosted person could hold a per-part claim, and
    ``_blocking`` never blocks an agent, so nobody would be protected from
    anybody. PRD-008's whole concurrency protection would have switched off
    silently on the day hosting turned on, with no error anywhere.

    The ``browser``/else behaviour below is byte-identical, which is what
    keeps local mode unchanged; the four consumers (``comments``,
    ``presence``, ``locks._kind`` and ``proposals`` itself) import this

        """The gate, then PRD-001's merge — which is not re-implemented,
        re-checked or wrapped.

        Gates are evaluated and a red one refuses **before** anything is
        merged, so a blocked proposal never leaves a staged merge behind.
        Then ``MergeOrchestrator.merge`` runs and its three outcomes are
        forwarded: success is recorded on the proposal (state ``merged``,
        packet frozen, audit ``merged`` plus ``override`` when the kernel
        gate was overridden); a returned ``merge_conflict`` is passed through
        **verbatim** with only ``details.proposal`` added, leaving the state
        alone; a raised blocked-validation ``validation_error`` propagates with
        the same one addition.

        The staged merge left behind by either of the last two is **held** by
        this proposal (``held_by``): ``resolve_merge`` records resolutions
        against it but cannot land it, because landing it there would skip
        every gate above. The second ``proposal_merge`` re-evaluates them
        against the branches as they are then and finishes it
        (:meth:`_orchestrate`); CLOSING the proposal aborts it instead
        (:meth:`_release_staged_merge`), because a hold must not outlive the
        gates that would have released it. A pair whose staged merge is held
        by anyone else is refused before PRD-001 is asked anything.

        ``allow_invalid`` reaches PRD-001's kernel gate and nothing else — it
        is the caller's statement about the kernel's verdict on geometry, and
        letting it also waive the approvals policy would make one field mean
        two unrelated things (FR11).

        **Locking.** PRD-001 holds the TARGET branch's turn across validation
        and finalization (``MergeOrchestrator._holding_target``). This layer
        holds the SOURCE branch's turn across gate evaluation and the merge
        call, because a gate result is a statement about a specific source
        head: without it another client could commit between "specs pass" and
        the orchestrator resolving the ref, and the merge would land content no
        gate ever saw. The order is fixed — proposal takes the source, the
        orchestrator takes the target — and cannot deadlock in any case:
        ``TurnLock.acquire`` never blocks, it raises, so two proposals merging
        in opposite directions produce a clean ``conflict_error``.
