"""Tool pack: configurations (PRD-012).

Five tools — ``set_part_configs``, ``list_configs``, ``build_configs``,
``set_active_config``, ``set_instance_config`` — each validating before it
writes, publishing ``project_changed`` exactly once *after* its write (which is
what makes the history snapshot and the undo step land on the new state), and
returning post-state rather than a bare OK.

The pack sorts at ``con``, before ``drawing`` / ``holes`` / ``packages`` /
``proposals`` / ``specs`` / ``vision``: at ``register()`` time
``service.specs``, ``service.packages`` and ``service.gate_providers`` do not
exist yet, so nothing here reads a later pack's seam at registration (and
nothing ever appends to ``gate_providers`` — ``tools_proposals`` resets it
unconditionally, the ``tools_run_checks`` trap).

Word choice: the object is a **configuration**, the field is ``configs``, and
``preset`` names only a configuration a *package* publishes.
