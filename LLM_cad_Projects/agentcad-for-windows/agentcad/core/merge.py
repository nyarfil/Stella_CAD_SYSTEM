"""Branch merge orchestration: three-way merge, staging, validation, commit.

A merge here is a real git merge — two parents, native refs, readable by any
git client — but the *content* merge is ours: part scripts go through
``git merge-tree --write-tree`` (textual, conflict markers), while
``project.json`` is **always** re-merged by ``manifest_merge`` at CAD key
granularity, whether or not git thought it merged cleanly. A line-wise merge of
a JSON manifest is either garbage or, worse, a clean result nobody authored.

Not everything tracked is text: ``imports/`` holds STL/STEP payloads. Those are
read, staged and resolved as raw BYTES — a binary conflict carries sizes and
digests instead of sides, takes ``ours``/``theirs``/``base`` and nothing else,
and never sees a conflict marker. Taking a side that does not exist (the branch
deleted the path) removes the path from the merged tree.

``ours`` is the TARGET branch (what you merge into) and ``theirs`` the SOURCE,
matching ``git merge <source>``. Conflicts are *returned* as a
``{"error": {"type": "merge_conflict", …}}`` payload, never raised: the tool
registry derives error types from exception class names, and FR7 fixes the
type string. Nothing outside ``.history/agentcad/`` is touched while conflicts
are outstanding — the merge is staged in a detached worktree until it is
resolved (``resolve_merge``) or discarded (``merge_abort``).

A staged merge may be **held** (``held_by``), which is the one thing a caller
can add to it: ``resolve_merge`` then records resolutions but stops short of
finalizing even at zero outstanding, and only the holder lands it, through
``finalize_held``. PRD-002 is the holder — a proposal's gates would otherwise
be something you could walk past by conflicting, since the last resolution
would land the branch with nobody re-checking them. A merge nobody holds is
untouched by any of this.

Before a merge lands — fast-forward included, FR9 has no exemption — the merged
tree is validated by the real kernel: changed parts rebuild, mates re-resolve,
and interference is re-checked. Validation runs through the *ordinary* service
methods with the branch resolver pinned to the merged worktree
(``BranchManager.pinned``), so the mesh cache, the kernel pool and the mates
resolver are reused verbatim — a part already built on either branch is a cache
hit. Failures block by default; ``allow_invalid`` lands the merge with the
failures recorded in the commit message and returned to the caller.

Finalization is a ``commit-tree`` with both parents plus a compare-and-swap
``update-ref``: a commit that landed on the target while the merge was staged
fails the swap and surfaces as a ``conflict_error`` instead of silently
clobbering it. The CAS guards the REF; the target branch's **turn lock is held
across validation and finalization** to guard the BYTES, because the
``reset --hard`` that syncs the tree would otherwise destroy a write that
arrived while the kernel was busy. And because ``update-ref`` has to precede
that sync, a failed sync rolls the ref back under its own CAS — a branch never
ends up pointing at a commit its working tree never received.
