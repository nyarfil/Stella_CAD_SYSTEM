"""Structure-aware three-way merge for project.json (pure Python, no I/O).

A line-wise merge of a JSON manifest produces garbage (or, worse, a *clean*
result that nobody authored). This module merges the manifest at CAD key
granularity instead — one independent decision per parameter, per part field,
per instance field, per material — and reports what it could not decide.

Key space (every leaf merges independently)::

    schema_version | name | units | materials_library            whole value
    <any other top-level key>                                    whole value
    parts.<id>                       entry add/remove, else field-wise:
      parts.<id>.label|material|kind|source                     whole value
      parts.<id>.active_config                                  whole value
      parts.<id>.params.<name>                                  per parameter
      parts.<id>.solid_materials.<key>                          per key
      parts.<id>.bom.<field>                                    per field
      parts.<id>.configs.<name>      entry add/remove, else field-wise:
        …<name>.label|description                               whole value
        …<name>.params.<param>                                  per parameter
      parts.<id>.pmi                                            atomic
    assembly.instances.<id>          entry add/remove, else field-wise:
      …<id>.part|position|rotation_deg|color|mate|config        whole value
    materials.<id>                                              atomic
    packages.<name>                                             atomic
    packages_lock.<name>                                        atomic
    releases.<rev>                                              atomic

``pmi`` is atomic because its frames cross-reference each other by id;
``materials.<id>`` because merging one side's density with the other's yield
strength is over-clever; ``position``/``rotation_deg`` because merging X from
one side and Z from the other yields a placement nobody authored; and the two
package maps (PRD-011) because merging one side's ``version`` with the other's
``content_id`` yields a lock entry nobody authored and that verifies against
nothing. Per *name* they merge key-wise, so two branches adding two different
packages merge clean — which is the whole reason the maps carry only
content-determined values.

``parts.<id>.configs`` (PRD-012) goes the other way, and the contrast is the
argument: a lock entry is *content-determined*, so half of one verifies against
nothing, while a configuration is a **set of independent parameter values** —
exactly what makes ``parts.<id>.params`` merge per key, one level deeper. So
the map merges per NAME (two branches adding two different configurations of
one part merge clean, FR12) and a configuration present on all three sides
merges per FIELD, with its ``params`` per parameter. Add/add of the same name
and delete/modify still conflict on the whole configuration, and a map entry
that is not a dict (a hand edit, an authored null) merges whole rather than
being silently rewritten to ``{}``. ``active_config`` and an instance's
``config`` are single selections, so they are whole values.

Values compare by type *and* JSON shape, so ``6`` and ``6.0`` are different
values — matching how params are stored and how a byte comparison of
project.json would see them.

Two encodings in the conflict payload are load-bearing:

* **absence is not null.** A side that has no such key OMITS its entry
  (``"ours"`` simply is not there); a side that authored a JSON ``null``
  reports ``null``. Conflating them made ``take: "ours"`` on an authored null
  delete the key.
* **the key is a display string, the path is the truth.** ``key`` is the
  dotted address a caller resolves against, but ids may contain dots
  (``solid_materials.wall.inner``), so every conflict also carries ``path``:
  the exact segments :func:`apply_choices` writes through. Nothing re-splits
  a key on ``.``.

Referential integrity is deliberately not this module's job: one side deleting
a part while the other adds an instance of it touches no common key, so it
merges clean. The kernel validation pass is the backstop.

    ``packages`` and ``packages_lock`` merge as two independent maps, each
    atomic *per package name* — which is right, and not enough. The two maps
    are one fact in two halves: `packages.foo` is what was asked for and
    `packages_lock.foo` is what that request resolved to. Resolving the
    requirement from **theirs** and the lock from **ours** is a clean merge of
    each map and a dependency **no branch ever authored** — a `^2.0.0`
    requirement pinned to a `1.0.0` lock, or a declaration pinning `corp` over
    a lock that came from `agentcad-core`. Nothing downstream catches it:
    `use_part` reads only the lock, and the lock verifies against its own
    content id perfectly well.

    So it is checked where PRD-001 already checks a merged manifest for
    structural damage — `merge._integrity`'s call site — and it returns the
    same problem shape, so a violation surfaces as an ordinary merge failure
    rather than a new mechanism. Silent is the one thing it must not be.

    ``package_requirement_violated``

    ``package_index_mismatch``

    ``parts.<id>.configs`` merges per name and a *selection* of one of those
    names — ``parts.<id>.active_config``, ``assembly.instances.<id>.config`` —
    is a whole value in another key. One branch removing a configuration while
    the other selects it touches no common key, so the merge is clean by design
    and the selection now names nothing. It is the shape of damage
    :func:`package_problems` exists for, and the tool choke points cannot see
    it: each side was valid where it was written.

    Three kinds, and the difference is deliberate (Decision 9):

    ``dangling_instance_config``
        an instance bound to a configuration the merged part no longer
        declares. **Blocking**, like ``dangling_instance``: the binding is the
        instance's whole parameter set, so it resolves to nothing.
    ``dangling_active_config``
        a part whose ``active_config`` is gone. A **warning**: an unknown
        active configuration resolves as base (Decision 3), so the project is
        loadable and someone only has to re-pick.
    ``malformed_configuration``
        a *member* that is not an object with a ``params`` map. The same
        clean-merge damage one level down: ``_merge_entry`` takes a non-object
        configuration entry **whole**, so one branch replacing ``m`` with a
        null (or a scalar) is enough. A **warning** for the same reason as the
        one above — ``PartRecord.config_params`` resolves it as an empty
        configuration, so the project loads; what it must not do is load
        *silently*, because the member now holds no parameters at all.

    Silent on a project with no configurations, on ``{}``, and on a healthy
    family. An instance whose *part* is missing is skipped —
    ``merge._integrity``'s ``dangling_instance`` already says so, and saying it
