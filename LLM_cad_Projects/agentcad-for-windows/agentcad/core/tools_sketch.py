"""2D constraint-solved sketch tool pack.

Wraps the first-party scipy solver (agentcad.toolkit.sketch) so agents can
solve a constrained sketch to exact coordinates, then feed those into a normal
build123d BuildLine/BuildSketch in a part script.

**`over_constrained` is not an error; unsatisfiable is.** A redundant but
consistent constraint set solves fine and comes back `ok: true` with
`diagnostics.redundant` listing what was ignored — every incumbent sketcher
tells you about a duplicate and carries on. Only a non-empty
`diagnostics.conflicting` (equivalently `max_residual > 1e-7`) raises, and it
raises with the whole diagnostics block attached so an agent can act on it.

    "tangent_line_circle, tangent_circles, tangent, symmetric, equal_length, "

    "[x,y], end: [x,y]}, compiled to the centre form at ingestion). Angles "
    "are **degrees, counter-clockwise**, and an arc adds exactly three "
    "parameters — r, start, end — plus the two its centre point costs. Its "
    "endpoints are the **virtual handles** `<name>.start` and `<name>.end`: "
    "write them anywhere a point name goes (`{type: coincident, p: "
    "\"arc1.end\", q: \"p3\"}`) and the whole point vocabulary applies to "

    "mirrors two points — or two lines, endpoint-for-endpoint in declaration "
    "order — about a line, in **two rows**: the midpoint lies on the axis and "
    "the pair is perpendicular to it. `equal_length {l1, l2}` and `concentric "
    "{a, b}` (2 rows, centre coincidence) complete the set. The v1 names "
    "`tangent_line_circle` and `tangent_circles` keep working unchanged — "
    "`tangent` is a new front door, not a rename. When the two curves already "

    "a junction point to it — tangency compiles to a **direction** residual "
    "(the two tangents are parallel there) instead of a distance one, still 1 "
    "row: the distance form is second-order flat at a junction and reports "
    "itself as redundant (measured singular value 1.8e-16 against a 8.5e-9 "

    "costs 3 parameters (a, b, rotation) plus 2 when bounded. Angles are the "
    "**eccentric anomaly** in degrees: the point at t is center + R(rotation) "
    "(a cos t, b sin t), which is exactly build123d's `EllipticalCenterArc` "
    "parametrization (measured to 8.9e-16 mm), so the solved angles are the "
    "emitted ones. Handles: `<name>.center`; `<name>.major` and "
    "`<name>.minor`, the ends of the two semi-axes, which are ordinary point "
    "handles — so `distance`, `coincident`, `horizontal` and the rest pin an "
    "ellipse's size and orientation with no new constraint type; and "
    "`<name>.start` / `<name>.end` on a bounded arc. The semi-axes are also "
    "scalar handles `<name>.a` / `<name>.b`, which `radius` and `equal_radius` "
    "accept (an ellipse has two radii, so you name the one you mean). "
    "`concentric` accepts an ellipse. `tangent` accepts ellipse+line and "
    "ellipse+circle/arc: point-to-ellipse distance has no closed form, so it "
    "carries the tangency point's anomaly as an auxiliary parameter "
    "(`<name>.tangency`, +1 parameter and +2 rows — still one degree of "
    "freedom removed) unless the two curves already meet at a pinned "
    "junction, where the direction residual applies and there is no auxiliary "
    "parameter at all. **Out of scope, deliberately:** tangency between two "

    "c2, width} compiles at ingestion into two arcs and two lines with **one "

    "rather than blaming a constraint you did not write. `initial` seeds a "

    "the pull's own slack is reported as `drag.gap`. Default weight 0.05, "
    "measured. Send it with `initial` seeded from the **previous frame's "
    "solution**, never from the cursor: seeding the dragged point at the "
    "cursor is what causes a mirror-branch flip when the cursor crosses the "
    "boundary, and the weak pull is what prevents one. Dragging a "
    "fully-constrained entity moves it (almost) not at all — that is correct, "

_DIAGNOSTICS_MODE = (

    "The cache is keyed on the compiled residual structure and the constraint "

_EMIT = (

    "produces byte-identical code either way. Curves are anchored on their "
    "shared solved endpoints at 9 decimals behind a 1e-8 mm closure gate: "
    "measured, a centre-parametrized arc chain at 6 decimals leaves a 7.58e-7 "

_PERSIST = (
    "Optional: also write the **round-trip block** (FR10) around the emitted "
