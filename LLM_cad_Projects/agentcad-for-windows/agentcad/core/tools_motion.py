"""Tool pack: motion from mates — sweep a mated instance's driven DOF.

``sweep_motion`` drives one mate parameter (revolute/cylindrical ``angle`` or
cylindrical ``position``) across an inclusive [start, end] range, re-resolving
the mate graph and checking pairwise interference at each sample in the
kernel. Connector-type validation is left to the mate resolver: an angle sweep
against a rigid anchor (or an offset sweep against a revolute one) surfaces
the resolver's contract error rather than costing an extra kernel round-trip.
