"""PRD-008 slice 7: per-part soft claims at the ``write_guard`` seam.

The riskiest slice in the plan: it inserts a wrapper into the one seam every
persistent write passes through. Four things are therefore asserted here more
loudly than anywhere else in the feature.

**The precedence order** (design Decision 14) is turn → own-turn bypass →
claim → proceed. The turn lock decides first with its existing code path,
message and details; AC6's regression gate is that ``tests/test_locks.py``
passes *unmodified*, and it does.

**Claims are human-vs-human only.** If an agent's write were blocked by a
human's open editor, the flagship loop — human pins a comment on a face, agent
fixes it and replies — would 409 on the agent's very first write. Two tests
pin both directions.

**Coverage is bounded and honest.** Only ``write_script`` and
``update_part_entry`` carry a ``locks.write_scope``, so only the script and the
params/material/label paths are claim-covered. ``add_part``, ``remove_part``,
assembly edits, project materials, restore and undo are whole-manifest or
project-wide writes and are turn-locked *only* — pretending otherwise would be
a lie told by a green test, so a test says so out loud instead.

**The guard installs lazily** (risk R7), because tool packs load alphabetically
and ``tools_versioning`` (``v``) *replaces* ``write_guard`` after anything at
``c`` could have wrapped it. So the wrapper is (re)installed from
``routes_presence.build_router`` and from every claims entry point, and
``checks.py``'s ephemeral service — which nulls the guard on purpose — must
still end with no guard at all.
