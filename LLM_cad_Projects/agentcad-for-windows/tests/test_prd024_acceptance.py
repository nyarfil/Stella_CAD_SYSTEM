"""PRD-024 acceptance — AgentCAD-Bench.

Three of these are slow by construction: **every** shipped reference is built
and scored (AC1), **every** checked-in STEP datum is re-exported and compared
to its script (design D9), and the example external submission is scored
through the real `agentcad bench score` process boundary (AC6). They carry
explicit `@pytest.mark.timeout`s because the global one is 120 s.

The rest are cheap, structural, and PR-blocking: the bench adds **no**
model-facing tool (AC9), no bench module imports OCP/build123d or an `[fem]`
extra (AC9/FR3), the bench workflow lives in its own file and never lets a
`pull_request` reach the job that holds the API key (D20), and `ci.yml` — which
`tests/test_prd006_acceptance.py` asserts byte-wise — is untouched by all of
it.

Parallel safety: every test that takes the kernel uses the session-scoped
`kernel` fixture over its **own** projects root, and nothing here writes into
`benchmarks/`, which is a read-only input. The one test that re-exports a
reference does it from a copy staged under its own projects root, never in
place.
