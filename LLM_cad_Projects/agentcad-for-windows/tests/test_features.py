"""PRD-010 slices 9 and 10 — `toolkit.features`: ribs, bosses, draft.

Two measured facts drive every assertion in here, both taken through the
kernel worker (changelogs 0155 and 0156):

* **A rib that misses the part is a silent success.** Fusing a rib solid 25 mm
  above `prototyping/enclosure_base` took 50.9 ms, raised nothing, reported
  `is_valid True` and *increased* the volume by the rib's full 960 mm^3 — the
  volume delta looks exactly like a rib that worked. Only the solid count (2,
  not 1) and the engagement probe (`part & rib` = 0 mm^3) tell them apart, so
  those are what the guard measures and what these tests assert.
* **Draft fails silently far more often than it raises.** Sweeping 0.25 -> 60
  degrees, the dominant failure is `draft()` *returning* a shape with
  `is_valid False` and a plausible positive volume (a shelled box at 1 deg:
  32421 mm^3, invalid). Only the extreme angles raise. So `features.draft`
  validates every attempt and these tests assert the result is always valid.
