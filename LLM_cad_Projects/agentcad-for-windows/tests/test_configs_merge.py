"""PRD-012 slice 5, the orchestrator half: a dangling selection through a REAL merge.

`tests/test_manifest_merge.py` proves the driver reaches
`parts.<id>.configs.<name>.params.<param>` and that
`manifest_merge.config_problems` names the damage the key-wise merge cannot
see. What it cannot prove is that the damage *reaches a human*, so these tests
drive two real branches through `merge_branch` and read `validation` — the
surface PRD-001 already uses for structural merge damage — rather than
grepping the orchestrator's source. The shape is
`test_packages_index.py::test_a_real_merge_blocks_on_the_package_hybrid`.

The two kinds are deliberately asymmetric (Decision 9): an instance bound to a
configuration the merged part no longer declares resolves to *nothing*, so it
blocks; a part whose `active_config` is gone resolves as base, so it is a
warning that must not block.
