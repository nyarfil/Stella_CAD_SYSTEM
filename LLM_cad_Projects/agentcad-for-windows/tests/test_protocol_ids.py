"""PRD-006 slice 2 — request ids, the usage envelope, and what the client
concludes from the worker's report.

The risk (design spec, "Risks"): a part script may `os.fork()`, and the child
inherits fd 1 — the protocol stream. With a counter for ids, a **lingering**
child (or any stale writer) can compute the ids of requests it never saw — a
later build, an export, another part's request — and answer them. Random ids
end that: an id it did not observe is a 62-bit guess.

What they deliberately do NOT close: the running script can still forge the
response to its own in-flight request, since it holds fd 1 and can reach the
id through the interpreter. That is the same trust domain as `build()` simply
returning a fake shape, and no fd redesign is warranted for it.

The same door carries the meter (Decision 6): every response line, result and
error alike, arrives with a `usage` object, and the client keeps the last one.
