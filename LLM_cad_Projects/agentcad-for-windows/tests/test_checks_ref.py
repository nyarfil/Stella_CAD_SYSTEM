"""``--ref`` and ``--verify-determinism`` (PRD-004, slice 3).

This is the riskiest code in geometry CI: it touches the user's git
repository. So the assertions here are about *containment* first and
measurement second.

* **AC7 — a ref check leaves the project byte-identical.** Every file under
  the project directory is hashed before and after; the maps must be equal,
  ``.cache/`` included. The ref is materialized into a throwaway detached
  worktree and measured by a second, ephemeral service rooted there.
* **The ephemeral service must never commit into the user's repository.** It
  is one forgotten line (``bus.on_publish = None``) away from doing exactly
  that through the linked worktree, so head, commit count, ``git status`` and
  the worktree registry are all pinned — including after an exception injected
  mid-run.
* **Refs resolve branch → tag → commit, never through ``rev-parse``.** git
  searches tags *before* branches, so an ambiguous name resolves as the branch
  and says so (PRD-001 X1).
* **A ref check measures the commit.** A branch with uncommitted edits is
  reported ``source.dirty`` and measured as of its last snapshot — a check may
  not snapshot on the user's behalf.
* **AC6 — determinism.** Every part built a second time on a cold cache, with
  ``.acm``/``.faces.u32``/metrics/SVG compared byte for byte. DXF is excluded
  by name, because ezdxf stamps a timestamp and fresh GUIDs into every
  document it creates.

The git admin directory (``.history/``) is excluded from the byte-identity map
and asserted separately (head, commit count, ``status``, the worktree list):
git's own bookkeeping — a worktree registration, an index stat refresh — is
git's, and the design says plainly that a stale registration is expected and
self-healing. What must not move is a single byte the *user* owns.
