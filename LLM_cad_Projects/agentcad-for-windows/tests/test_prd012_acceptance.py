"""PRD-012 acceptance — configurations, AC1–AC9.

One test per criterion, each naming it in its docstring, each graded against
the shipped surface rather than a stub built for the occasion.

| AC | Test |
|---|---|
| AC1 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac1_the_family_builds_as_one_matrix_of_three_distinct_masses` |
| AC2 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac2_the_drawing_tabulates_one_measured_row_per_configuration` |
| AC3 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac3_removing_a_bound_configuration_names_the_instance` |
| AC4 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac4_a_configuration_export_is_suffixed_and_the_base_one_is_not` |
| AC5 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac5_identical_parameter_maps_share_one_cache_entry` |
| AC6 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac6_two_instances_of_one_part_are_two_sizes` |
| AC7 | `TestTheFlangeFamily::test_ac7_an_override_diverges_and_removing_it_returns_to_the_configuration` |
| AC8 | `test_ac8_a_project_without_configurations_is_byte_identical` + `test_ac8_the_full_suite_count_is_cited` |
| AC9 | `test_ac9_the_ui_surfaces_exist_and_the_session_was_clean` |

Three of them are worth reading before you believe them:

* **AC5 is anchored by a kernel-call counter, not by a key comparison.** Two
  equal strings prove the *service* agreed with itself; what the criterion
  claims is that the second configuration cost no geometry. So the matrix runs
  with `service.kernel.request` counted by method, and the assertion is that a
  four-member family with three distinct parameter maps issues exactly three
  `build` calls — and that toggling `active_config` afterwards issues none.
* **AC8 is two claims and they are graded separately.** "Byte-identical
  without configurations" is measured against `test_examples_golden.GOLDENS`
  on a **copy** of the bundled `examples/rocketry` — the same mesh sha PRD-010
  pinned — plus the raw manifest carrying neither new key. "Full suite green"
  is a claim about a *run*, so it stays an evidence check on the newest
  changelog entry (the PRD-004 AC10 / PRD-011 AC8 precedent).
* **AC9 is a browser session, and a test cannot be one.** The session is in
  changelog `0207-configs-ui.md` (real headless Chrome, `ERROR COUNT: 0` /
  `FAILED REQUESTS: 0`). What a test grades is the *evidence*: the surfaces
  that session drove still exist, the routes they call are still mounted, and
  the entry still records the counts.
