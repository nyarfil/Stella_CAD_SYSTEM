"""PRD-008 slice 6: presence — the registry, the heartbeat, browser identity.

Four sections: 1. the registry · 2. the heartbeat routes · 3. the event ·
4. the seams (identity, mentions).

The one thing worth stating before reading: **presence arrives over HTTP, not
over the WebSocket** (design Decision 13). ``/ws`` lives in ``server/app.py``,
a core the extension-point contract forbids editing; it carries no client
identity, because ``set_client_id`` is HTTP middleware only; and its Host guard
is HTTP middleware too. So the tests below drive presence with ordinary
requests, and the assertion that matters most is that the heartbeat *response*
carries the whole roster: ``presence_changed`` is an optimization, and a client
that misses every event still converges within one heartbeat. That is also why
there is no reaper thread to test — expiry is computed on read, which
:func:`test_expiry_is_lazy_and_starts_no_thread` pins.
