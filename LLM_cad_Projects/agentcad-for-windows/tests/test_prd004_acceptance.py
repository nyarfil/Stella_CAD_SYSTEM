"""PRD-004 acceptance criteria — one named test per AC (slice 8).

The feature's mechanics are covered in depth by ``tests/test_checks.py`` (the
pure report layer), ``tests/test_checks_pipeline.py`` (the four stages over a
live service), ``tests/test_checks_ref.py`` (``--ref`` containment and the
determinism guard), ``tests/test_checks_cli.py`` (the command and its exit
codes), ``tests/test_checks_api.py`` (the tool, the routes and
``check_finished``), ``tests/test_checks_gate.py`` (posting and the proposal
gate) and ``tests/test_geometry_ci_action.py`` (the Action and the dogfood
workflow). This file is the *contract* layer: it walks each acceptance
criterion of ``docs/prd/in-progress/PRD-004-geometry-ci.md`` end to end through
the surfaces a user and an agent actually touch — the ``run_checks`` tool, the
HTTP passthrough MCP proxies, the real console script, git and the bundled
examples on a copy — so a reviewer can map AC → test without reading the unit
suites.

| AC | Test |
|----|------|
| AC1 | ``test_ac1_the_dogfood_workflow_certifies_the_bundled_examples`` — the
        workflow/action *shape* plus the changelog's live-run record; the green
        run itself is cited in the PR and in
        ``docs/changelog/0105-prd-004-docs-and-acceptance.md`` (the PRD-001 AC6
        / PRD-003 AC8 evidence-check precedent — a live CI run cannot be
        re-driven from the suite) |
| AC2 | ``test_ac2_interference_in_construction_is_red_in_both_renderings`` |
| AC3 | ``test_ac3_a_broken_spec_names_the_check_with_measured_and_limit`` |
| AC4 | ``test_ac4_a_script_error_carries_the_update_part_script_payload`` |
| AC5 | ``test_ac5_the_three_exit_codes_and_a_report_that_validates`` |
| AC6 | ``test_ac6_verify_determinism_passes_on_a_bundled_example`` |
| AC7 | ``test_ac7_checking_a_tag_leaves_the_project_byte_identical`` |
| AC8 | ``test_ac8_without_the_fem_extra_a_check_skips_and_strict_flips_it`` |
| AC9 | ``test_ac9_the_mcp_passthrough_and_the_cli_report_the_same_thing`` |
| AC10 | ``test_ac10_the_full_suite_count_is_cited`` — the evidence check over
         the slice-8 changelog; the run itself is `make test` |

Two recorded deviations are asserted **as designed**, not worked around:

* **The report is honest; ``--strict`` is the opt-in.** A ``skip`` row keeps
  its status, its reason and its hint under ``--strict`` — only the derived
  verdict moves (AC8). PRD-003's ``specs`` gate is the fail-closed reading of
  the same measurements and stays that way.
* **A reference part's ``is_valid`` is reported, never enforced** (changelog
  0099): OCCT calls the shipped rocketry STEP import invalid, exactly as
  ``tests/test_examples.py`` records, so the row passes and the fact travels in
  ``details.is_valid`` plus a warning.

Everything here drives the **real** service (whose publish hook snapshots into
git), so the module carries ``integration`` + ``portability`` and skips without
git; every case that builds geometry is additionally ``slow``. Examples are
always used on a ``copytree`` copy that is **renamed** first, so a copy can
never collide by name with the original a CLI registers at startup.
