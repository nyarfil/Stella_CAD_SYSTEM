"""PRD-005a: the anonymous surface, enumerated and proved kernel-free.

The three tests the design leans on (Decision 12):

1. **The enumeration.** Walk the fully-mounted hosted app and assert the set
   of anonymous-reachable routes equals a literal list. It fails when a route
   pack goes public by accident — PRD-007 AC9's test, delivered early because
   it is what makes PRD-007 safe to write.
2. **Kernel silence.** Exercise every public route with the kernel
   instrumented and assert zero requests (FR16 / AC7).
3. **Local mode unchanged.** In `test_security_guard.py`, where the guard
   lives.

`EXPECTED_PUBLIC` is written **once, in full**, with a `NOT_YET_BUILT`
subtrahend that later slices shrink. Set *equality* rather than a subset check
is what stops a forgotten removal from passing silently, and writing the final
list once is what stops the enumeration drifting slice by slice.
