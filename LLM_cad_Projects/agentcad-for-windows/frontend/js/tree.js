// Left sidebar: the parts folder tree and the assembly instance tree, both
// VIRTUALIZED (PRD-027 FR2/FR7). Pure render from state; every mutation goes
// through the panel API `main.js` injects, or through the tools in `api.js`.
//
// What this module is and is not. Every ordering, filtering, selection and
// persistence RULE lives in the pure models — `tree_model.js` (the folder
// flatten, the match-bubbling filter, the Finder click table, the stored
// collapse state), `query_model.js` (the grammar) and `virtual_model.js` (the
// window arithmetic). What is left here is DOM: turn a row descriptor into an
// `<li>`, keep the rendered window in sync with `scrollTop`, and route a click,
// a key or a drop to the right verb. That split is why the interesting half of
// this feature is graded in node and only the pixels need a browser.
//
// Three things are load-bearing and easy to break:
//
//   * **Rows are exactly `ROW_HEIGHT` px.** The virtual window is division, not
//     a measured-offset table (see `virtual_model.js`), so a row that grows to
//     29 px makes the scrollbar lie by a row per thirty. `.side-list > .row`
//     pins the height in `app.css`; the thumbnail is 24 px inside it.
//   * **`virtual_model.js` is imported NAMESPACED.** `import { window }` would
//     shadow the browser global for this whole file, and `window.addEventListener`
//     below would silently call the model.
//   * **The row's `×` button is gone** (ruling 7). Delete lives in the context
//     menu and the bulk bar: a thousand-row list with a delete button per row
//     is a misclick farm. `actions.deletePart` is untouched and still the verb.
