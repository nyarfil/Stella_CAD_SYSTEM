"""ISO 4762 socket-head cap screw, M3–M12, over ``agentcad.toolkit.threads``.

Origin and orientation, which are what a mate depends on: the **under-head
bearing face is at local z = 0**, the head rises to +z (to ``k``, the head
height) and the threaded shank runs down to ``z = -length``. So ``head_seat``
is the origin itself and the shank goes into the material.

``thread`` is the cosmetic-vs-real choice `agentcad/toolkit/threads.py`
documents, exposed as a parameter rather than decided for you:

* ``"cosmetic"`` — the shank is drawn as a plain cylinder. Fast (~0.05 s), light
  (~1k triangles). This is what you want for assembly views, fit checks and
  interference, and it is the default.
* ``"real"`` — true ISO helical thread geometry (~9k triangles per thread, and
  the build cost grows with the number of turns: an M3 × 60 takes ~2 s where an
  M8 × 16 takes ~0.13 s). Use it for a manufacturing drawing or when the thread
  itself has to mate.

The two are dimensionally identical outside the thread flanks — same head, same
length, same bearing face — so switching does not move a mate. The **shank
diameter** is the exception and it matters: cosmetic is drawn at the thread
*root* (⌀4.134 on M5), real reaches the nominal *major* diameter (⌀5.000). A
cosmetic screw therefore drops into a PRD-010 tapped hole (tap drill ⌀4.2)
interference-free, and a real one engages it. See docs/README.md.

SPECS check the built screw against the **published ISO 4762 table** below, not
against whatever bd_warehouse happened to produce: the head diameter ``dk``, the
head height ``k`` and the length under the head are each measured from the built
solid and compared with the standard for the selected size. A ``check_that``
predicate is handed the shape ``build`` returned, and a bd_warehouse fastener
carries its own ``screw_size`` and ``length``, so the checks know which row of
the table they are entitled to — no module-level state and no guessing.
