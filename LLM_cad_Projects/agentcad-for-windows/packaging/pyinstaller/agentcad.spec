"""PyInstaller onedir spec for the AgentCAD single-binary distribution.

Build with scripts/build_binary.sh (or `make dist`); the result is
dist/agentcad/ with an `agentcad` executable that serves the app — server,
frontend, examples, and the OCCT kernel worker (which the executable re-execs
in itself via the hidden `worker` subcommand; see agentcad/_spawn.py).
