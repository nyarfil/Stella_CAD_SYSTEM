# 0308 — Degenerate-boolean detection: an intersection OCCT cannot compute fails closed

- **Commit:** pending
- **Date:** 2026-08-23
- **Author:** Claude (Opus 5) with Nikita Fedorov

## Summary

OCCT 7.9's `BRepAlgoAPI_Common` (build123d's `&`) silently returns a wrong
answer — usually **empty**, sometimes negative-volume — for solids carrying
G1-tangent face junctions, i.e. any filleted swept solid. Both places that
boolean solid pairs read that empty result as `0.0` and banked it: the bench
scored a perfect candidate `iou: 0.0`, and `worker.pairwise_interference`
reported an overlapping assembly **clean**. This adds
`agentcad/kernel/handlers/_bop.py`, a shared detector, and makes both callers
fail closed on it — the bench with a kernel error (subscore `error`, excluded,
FR7), the product path with the pair listed and marked `degenerate: true`.

## The corrected root cause

The recorded narrative (changelog `0280`, `benchmarks/.../fix_005_invalid_shell/prompt.md`,
`docs/bench.md`, `AGENTS.md`) says the **STEP round trip** is the trigger and
that STEP-vs-STEP intersects cleanly. That is wrong, and changelog `0282:214-223`
already had the measurement right: STEP ⊗ STEP is degenerate too. Measured live
against the pinned venv, on the bench's own coolant elbow (`fix_005` reference
defaults — a Ø24 × 3 mm annulus swept along a 24 mm-radius right-angle bend,
21 711.685 mm³):

| operands | `A & B` |
|---|---|
| script ⊗ *itself* (same Python object) | 21 711.685 (correct) |
| script ⊗ independently rebuilt script | 21 711.685 (correct) |
| STEP ⊗ *itself* | 21 711.685 (correct) |
| **script ⊗ STEP re-import** | **empty** |
| **STEP ⊗ second STEP re-import** | **empty** |
| script(bend_r=24) ⊗ script(bend_r=30), both at the origin | **empty** |
| script ⊗ script shifted 1 mm in Z | 19 093.56 in a fresh process, **empty** when another boolean ran first |

So provenance is not the trigger; *sameness* is the thing that hides the bug —
when the two operands are the same shape OCCT takes a shortcut and answers
correctly. Two genuinely distinct tangent-jointed swept solids that overlap can
intersect to nothing. Worse, the shifted-pair row above shows the failure is
**order-dependent inside one process**: an earlier boolean changes whether the
next one tells the truth. `IsDone()` is `True` throughout, nothing is raised,
and this OCP build exposes no `HasErrors()`. Fuzzy booleans at every tolerance,
`ShapeFix`, `UnifySameDomain`, sewing, `Copy`, `Glue` and OBB alignment were all
probed during the research pass and none of them help — which is why this
change is **detection**, not healing. Prose corrections land separately (T3).

## The detector (`agentcad/kernel/handlers/_bop.py`)

`checked_common_volume(solid_a, box_a, solid_b, box_b, volume_of) -> (volume, degenerate)`:

- a **positive** volume is trusted and returned as-is — the detector is never
  the measurement;
- a **negative** volume is impossible, so it is `(0.0, True)`. Both call sites
  used to launder exactly this: the bench with `max(volume, 0.0)`, the worker by
  summing it into the pair total;
- a **non-finite** volume is `(0.0, True)` too (every comparison against NaN is
  false, so it walked through both guards below);
- an **empty** result is rechecked *only when suspicious* — when the two AABBs
  overlap by at least `SUSPECT_OVERLAP_FRACTION = 0.5` of the smaller box. The
  recheck crops `solid_a` to each **octant** of the overlap box and booleans the
  pieces against `solid_b`, short-circuiting on the first hit. The subdivision
  is the mechanism, not an optimisation: an octant boundary cuts *through* the
  tangent junctions, leaving pieces OCCT handles correctly. A piece that
  intersects **by more than the caller's own `min_volume`** means the two
  computations disagree, so the whole-solid boolean lied. An exception raised
  inside the recheck is also a disagreement.

**The `min_volume` floor** (review fix). Without it the detector would be more
sensitive than the measurement it checks. `pairwise_interference` refuses to
*report* a pair below `min_volume` (default 0.001 mm³) precisely because OCCT
leaves ~1e-12 mm³ slivers at a tangential contact — so a recheck firing below
that line manufactures a pair the measurement would have discarded. The
realistic victim is a **zero-clearance fit**: a shaft exactly filling its bore,
a lip seated in its groove. Legitimately empty, ~100 % AABB overlap, therefore
reaching the recheck on *every* check — a sliver there would be permanent
phantom interference on the product path and `clear: False` on every motion
sweep. So `checked_common_volume` takes the caller's `min_volume`
(`worker.pairwise_interference` passes its own; the bench `iou` path, which has
no threshold of its own, takes the same 0.001 mm³ default), floored at
`_SLIVER_VOLUME_MM3 = 1e-9` so that an explicit `min_volume=0` — "report every
overlap" — still does not make float noise into evidence.

Measured on this machine: the degenerate coincident-elbow pair is detected in
0.38–0.76 s; a legitimate empty with 100 % AABB overlap (a hollow shell and a
core sitting in its cavity) costs 0.02 s and is **not** flagged; a near-miss
never reaches the recheck at all (0.00 s). Two elbows meeting face-to-face at
the origin (one rotated 180°) have zero AABB overlap volume, so the correct
empty is returned without a recheck.

**Cost analysis.** Nothing changes for a pair whose boolean succeeds — the only
added work is one `min()` and two comparisons. Only an *empty* result on a
suspicious pair pays anything, and the bill is then bounded at 8 crops plus one
boolean per resulting piece, short-circuited on the first hit.

**The selectivity claim is only true of whole-part pairs, and this changelog
should not have implied otherwise.** `worker.pairwise_interference` also reaches
the detector from its **crop branch**, where one operand has already been cut
down to the overlap box: the piece's AABB then sits entirely inside the other
solid's, so `_suspicious` is ~1.0 and the recheck fires on essentially *every*
empty result down that branch — which is the fastener path, the one with the
highest pair cardinality. That is measured, not theorised: forcing `_disagrees`
to return `True` drops the interference subscore of `asm_001_thrust_chamber`
(1.0000 → 0.7500), `asm_003_bolted_joint` (→ 0.5583), `asm_002_lid_on_base`
(→ 0.4250) and `asm_005_rod_and_piston` (→ 0.6833), while leaving
`asm_004_truss_node` at 1.0000 — so four of the five interference-weighted
references run the recheck.

What matters is that it costs nothing measurable and never lies: with the real
detector all five still score **1.0000**, and three timed runs of `asm_003` (the
most fastener-heavy reference) are 16.61/13.52/16.39 s with the recheck enabled
against 13.45/17.72/16.25 s with `_suspicious` stubbed to `False` —
indistinguishable from run-to-run noise. **Not measured:**
`handlers/motion.py:126` calls `pairwise_interference` once per sweep sample, so
whatever the recheck costs is multiplied by the sample count. `tests/test_motion.py`
is green and no sweep got visibly slower, but nobody has timed a long sweep over
a fastener-heavy assembly.

**Residual blind spots.** This narrows the hole; it does not close it, and the
first version of this section read as if it did. Three false negatives remain:

1. A degenerate *plausible-positive* result — some wrong non-zero volume — is
   not detected at all. Catching it would mean re-deriving every intersection by
   an independent method, which costs more than the measurement it checks. The
   order-dependence makes these real rather than hypothetical: two back-to-back
   evaluations of the *same* elbow pair in one process were observed answering
   "empty" and "924.22 mm³".
2. `SUSPECT_OVERLAP_FRACTION = 0.5` is a **coverage cliff, not only a cost
   gate**. A degenerate pair whose AABBs overlap by less than half the smaller
   box is banked clean exactly as before. Measured: the elbow pair shifted 40 mm
   in Z sits at an overlap fraction of **0.444** — one shift away from falling
   off the gate — so this is not a remote corner.
3. `_disagrees` is one subdivision level of one operand, evaluated by the *same*
   unreliable kernel. It can answer "no disagreement" on a pair that is
   genuinely degenerate, and there is no second opinion behind it.

## `worker.py` — a deliberate core edit

`AGENTS.md` forbids editing `worker.py` **"to add a feature"**. This is not a
feature: `pairwise_interference` is inside `worker.py` with no pack seam, and
its `_common_vol` is the exact line that banks the wrong answer. The edit is
kept minimal and in place:

- the function's **signature and return type are unchanged**;
- entries gain **one optional key**, `"degenerate": True`, emitted only when
  set. A reader that does not know the key sees an ordinary interfering pair —
  which is the safe reading;
- the pair-emit condition becomes `if volume > min_volume or degenerate:`, so a
  pair whose boolean failed is reported even though its measured volume is
  `0.0`;
- `_common_vol` now measures with `_shape_volume` (the solids sum) instead of
  `.volume`, closing the nested-Compound undercount on this path as a side
  effect.

`handle_interference`, `service.check_interference` and `handlers/motion.py`
need no change: `motion` reads `pairs → first_collision → clear=False`, which is
fail-closed by construction, and the extra key rides through the JSON protocol
untouched.

## Before and after (measured through the real kernel)

Pre-fix, with the detector stubbed back to "empty means clean":

```
PRE-FIX iou: {'iou': 0.0, 'intersection_mm3': 0.0, 'union_mm3': 43423.37,
              'candidate_volume_mm3': 21711.685, 'reference_volume_mm3': 21711.685,
              'status': 'ok'}
PRE-FIX interference: {'pairs': []}
```

A candidate that *is* the reference scored 0.0, and two coincident elbows were
reported as a clean assembly. Post-fix:

```
POST-FIX iou: kernel_error | iou unavailable: degenerate boolean — OCCT could
  not intersect this solid pair (tangent-jointed swept solids are unreliable BOP
  operands in OCCT 7.9); refusing to bank the empty result as a measurement | intersect
POST-FIX interference: {'pairs': [{'a': 'elbow_r24', 'b': 'elbow_r30',
                                   'volume_mm3': 0.0, 'degenerate': True}]}
ping: True
```

## AC1 safety (the five interference-weighted references measured at 1.0)

- `fix_005`'s `task.json` is byte-unchanged; its `geometry` weight is `0.00`, so
  the degenerate boolean never reaches its total. Verified: `bench score` on its
  reference project still reports **1.0000 over 4 subscore(s)**.
- A geometry-weighted reference (`mfd_003_head_flange`, geometry 0.50) still
  **1.0000**.
- **All five** interference-weighted `assemble_and_clear` references (weight
  0.40) still **1.0000** with `interference` `ok`/1.0000:

  | reference | score | recheck runs? |
  |---|---|---|
  | `asm_001_thrust_chamber` | 1.0000 | yes |
  | `asm_002_lid_on_base` | 1.0000 | yes |
  | `asm_003_bolted_joint` | 1.0000 | yes |
  | `asm_004_truss_node` | 1.0000 | no |
  | `asm_005_rod_and_piston` | 1.0000 | yes |

  `asm_002` is the maximal false-degenerate stressor — filleted parts, near-total
  AABB overlap, a legitimately empty intersection — and it both exercises the
  recheck and comes back clean. That is a *measured* absence of false positives
  on four references, not an untested path.
- The remaining references are not measured here; the orchestrator's full slow
  set covers them.
- Structurally, a reference whose booleans succeed today takes the *positive*
  branch and is untouched; only an empty-and-suspicious result runs new code.
- `interference_fraction` needs no change: a degenerate pair is *in* `pairs`, so
  it already costs the assembly its clean count. `score.json` gains the
  `degenerate` key only when set, so a clean run's bytes are unchanged (AC3).

## Changes

- **New** `agentcad/kernel/handlers/_bop.py` — the detector. Underscore-prefixed,
  so `worker._load_handler_packs` skips it (the `_pdf.py` precedent): it is a
  shared helper, not a handler pack.
- `agentcad/kernel/worker.py` — `pairwise_interference` routes every
  Solid-vs-Solid boolean through the detector and threads `degenerate` up
  through `_solid_common`'s crop branch into the emitted pair.
- `agentcad/kernel/handlers/bench.py` — `_common_volume` takes both AABBs and
  raises `WorkerError(ERROR_KERNEL, "iou unavailable: degenerate boolean — …",
  {"stage": "intersect"})` on a degenerate pair. It is raised inside `_guarded`'s
  reach, whose `except WorkerError: raise` keeps the type and stage intact, so
  `scoring._geometry_part`'s `KernelError` arm records `status: "error"` and
  **excludes** the subscore rather than banking a false 0.0. The module header's
  stale `worker.py:650-653` line reference is replaced with a name.
- `agentcad/core/specs.py` — `_eval_interference` still fails on a degenerate
  pair (it is in `pairs`) and now says why: `"; N indeterminate (OCCT could not
  boolean the pair — counted as interfering, fail-closed)"`. The clause is
  conditional, so an ordinary interfering row's message is byte-unchanged. It
  matters because a degenerate pair's `volume_mm3` is `0.0`, and `measured: 0.0`
  on its own reads as "they barely touch".
- `agentcad/bench/scoring.py` — `_interference` preserves `degenerate` into the
  pair detail, emitted only when set.
- `agentcad/core/checks.py` — `_pair_item` renders a degenerate pair as
  `"a and b: indeterminate (degenerate boolean) — counted as interfering"` and
  carries the flag into the row's `details`. The ordinary sentence would have
  said `"overlap by 0.0 mm³"`, which reads as a rounding artefact — the opposite
  of "the measurement did not happen".

## Files

- `agentcad/kernel/handlers/_bop.py` — new; `checked_common_volume`,
  `SUSPECT_OVERLAP_FRACTION`, `DEGENERATE_MIN_VOLUME_MM3`,
  `_SLIVER_VOLUME_MM3`, `_suspicious`, `_crop`, `_disagrees`. The module
  docstring is where the measured root cause, the honest selectivity story and
  the three residual blind spots live.
- `agentcad/kernel/worker.py` — `pairwise_interference` docstring, `_common_vol`
  (which now also passes its `min_volume` down as the detector's noise floor),
  `_solid_common`, the pair-emit block; one new import.
- `agentcad/kernel/handlers/bench.py` — module docstring (a fifth trap, "Four"
  → "Five", and the stale line reference), `_common_volume`, its one call site,
  one new import.
- `agentcad/core/specs.py` — `_eval_interference`'s fail message.
- `agentcad/bench/scoring.py` — `_interference`'s pair detail.
- `agentcad/core/checks.py` — `_pair_item`.
- `tests/test_kernel.py` — `test_two_overlapping_elbows_are_never_reported_clean`
  (the product-path regression) and
  `test_interference_does_not_cry_degenerate_on_a_clean_assembly` (the other
  half of the guard); `ELBOW_SCRIPT`. Plus the emit contract over a stubbed
  boolean — `test_the_degenerate_marker_rides_the_emitted_pair` (parametrised:
  `(0.0, True)` is emitted *and* marked despite being below `min_volume`;
  `(500.0, False)` grows no marker) and
  `test_a_clean_boolean_below_the_threshold_emits_no_pair` (the `or degenerate`
  did not turn the threshold into a no-op). Plus the detector's own unit tests:
  `test_the_recheck_ignores_slivers_below_the_callers_own_floor` (8 parametrised
  cases over a stubbed boolean — the threshold is arithmetic and is proved
  without asking OCCT anything),
  `test_a_zero_clearance_fit_is_empty_and_not_degenerate` (a real shaft exactly
  filling a real bore, both orders) and
  `test_the_intersection_is_measured_by_the_injected_volume_function`.
- `tests/test_checks.py` — `test_a_pair_the_kernel_could_not_boolean_reads_as_indeterminate`
  and `test_an_ordinary_overlapping_pair_keeps_the_sentence_it_always_had`.
  `CheckRunner._pair_item` touches no `self`, so both call it unbound and the
  file stays kernel-free, as its header promises.
- `tests/test_bench_kernel_iou.py` — `test_a_degenerate_boolean_is_refused_not_banked_as_a_zero`
  (STEP exported through the kernel; either a `KernelError` whose message,
  type and `stage: "intersect"` are pinned, or an honest `iou == 1.0` — never
  a silent 0.0 — and the worker still answering `ping` either way);
  `test_a_degenerate_pair_refuses_with_the_stage_the_scorer_reads` and
  `test_a_trusted_boolean_is_measured_and_not_refused`, both over a stubbed
  `checked_common_volume` so the refusal contract cannot drift with the
  platform; `ELBOW`; a docstring correction on
  `test_a_non_finite_intersection_is_an_error_too`, whose mechanism moved from
  `max(nan, 0.0)` into `_bop`.
- `tests/test_specs.py` — `test_a_pair_the_kernel_could_not_boolean_fails_and_says_so`
  and `test_a_measurable_overlap_keeps_the_message_it_always_had`, both
  kernel-free over a stub `check_interference`.
- `tests/test_bench_scoring.py` — `test_a_degenerate_pair_keeps_its_marker_in_the_detail`
  and `test_an_ordinary_pair_carries_no_degenerate_key`.

## Notes

- **The OCCT bug is platform-dependent, and the tests say so** (fix round 2,
  from a CI failure on `ubuntu-latest`). The coincident elbow pair that
  differs only in `bend_r` (24 vs 30) answers **empty on macOS** — hence
  `degenerate: True` — and **computes a real intersection volume on Linux**,
  on the same pinned build123d. Both are honest; only silence is not. The
  product-path regression therefore asserts the platform-invariant property —
  the pair is *reported*, with a marker or with a volume above `min_volume` —
  and the strict mechanics (marker plumbing, the emit-below-threshold rule, the
  sliver floor, the bench refusal's type/stage) are pinned over stubbed
  booleans, where no platform can move them. The same either/or treatment was
  applied preventively to the bench `iou` test: its script ⊗ STEP pair is
  degenerate on macOS *and* on Linux today (both CI Linux jobs run that file —
  `ci.yml`'s ubuntu portability leg via the module's `portability` mark, and
  `bench.yml`'s ubuntu self-test via `tests/test_bench_*.py`), but a platform
  that *fixed* the OCCT bug must make that test go green, not red. What it
  refuses to accept is the one dishonest answer: `iou: 0.0` for a candidate
  that is the reference.
- **Plan deviation, argued.** The plan's product-path regression called for two
  elbows with the second at `position=[0,0,5]`. Measured, that pair is **not**
  degenerate (11 194.235 mm³, reproducibly, in a fresh process); the shifted
  pairs that do fail (1 mm, 0.1 mm) fail only *order-dependently* and would make
  a flaky test. The test instead uses two elbows at the **same origin**
  differing only in `bend_r` (24 vs 30) — coincident legs down both axes,
  obviously overlapping, and empty from OCCT in five out of five fresh
  processes. Same code path, same claim, deterministic.
- **`_bop` is never imported from `agentcad/bench/**`** — it imports build123d,
  and `test_prd024_acceptance.py::test_ac9_no_bench_module_imports_ocp_or_build123d`
  is the guard. It is reached from the bench only through the kernel handler.
- A degenerate pair shows in the UI as an interfering pair with volume 0.0.
  Cosmetic, known, not fixed here.
- **The nested-Compound undercount is pinned with a stub, not with geometry.**
  `_common_vol` moving from `float(c.volume)` to `_shape_volume` closes a real
  hole (`Compound.volume` reports only the first child subtree of a *nested*
  compound), but a boolean that actually returns a nested compound could not be
  provoked cheaply — the multi-solid intersections tried came back flat, with
  `.volume` and the solids sum agreeing. The test therefore pins that
  `checked_common_volume` returns what the **injected** `volume_of` says, using
  a stub whose `.volume` attribute deliberately disagrees.
- `_disagrees` crops `solid_a` specifically. `pairwise_interference`'s
  `_solid_common` may have swapped the operands by then, so which solid gets
  cropped is not stable across callers — acceptable for a detector, and stated
  here so nobody reads determinism into it.

RED first: with `checked_common_volume`'s empty branch stubbed back to
`(0.0, False)` — the pre-fix behaviour — both kernel-backed tests fail. Since
fix round 2 the iou failure is the sharper one, `Obtained: 0.0 / Expected: 1.0
± 0.001` for a candidate that *is* the reference; the interference pair list is
empty. Restored, both pass.

`ruff check` clean on every touched file (`worker.py` keeps its pre-existing
E402 block — 15 before, 16 after, the new import line; the file's imports all
sit below `apply_from_env()` by design).

Fix round 1 also re-ran the RED probe after the `min_volume` change (stub the
empty branch back to `(0.0, False)`): both kernel tests still fail without the
guard and pass with it.

`make test` — 5411 passed, 50 skipped (branch tip; the slow AC1 set separately: 41 passed — all 25 references still 1.0)

## Follow-up (2026-08-23)

Filed upstream with a standalone reproduction:
<https://github.com/Open-Cascade-SAS/OCCT/issues/1496>. The reproduction
refined the trigger once more: an equivalent cylinder+torus+cylinder solid
built from primitives and fused does NOT reproduce — the lie is specific to
`BRepOffsetAPI_MakePipeShell` output (its seam/face parametrization), not to
tangent junctions in the abstract. `_bop.py`'s docstring carries the link.
