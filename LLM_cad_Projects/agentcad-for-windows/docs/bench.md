# AgentCAD-Bench — `agentcad bench`

A public, reproducible benchmark for **agentic CAD**: 25 tasks, driven through
the product's own tool surface, scored by the geometry kernel. Every number is
a measurement — a boolean intersection, a spec run, a bounding box — and there
is **no LLM judging anywhere** in the pipeline.

```bash
uv run agentcad bench score benchmarks/examples/submission-mfd-001 \
    --task model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate
```

```

The same five commands serve every audience: `bench run` drives an agent over a
task set, `bench score` measures one submission, `bench prompt` prints the exact
prompt an agent is handed, `bench report` aggregates a results directory and
gates it against a baseline, and `bench publish` renders the leaderboard. There
is **no bench tool, route or event** — see
[Why there is no `bench_*` tool](#why-there-is-no-bench_-tool).

**Sibling document:** [`docs/geometry-ci.md`](geometry-ci.md). `agentcad check`
certifies a *project*; `agentcad bench` scores an *agent*. Both drive the same
headless in-process service over one warm kernel, with no server and no port.

---

## Two rules to read the whole feature by

1. **A candidate that cannot be measured measures zero.** `error` means *the
   harness* failed to measure — a dead worker, a blown budget. `not_applicable`
   is declared by `task.json` (a zero weight) and is **never** decided by a
   run. A submission that is absent, unbuildable, mesh-only or simply wrong is
   *measured*, and it measures **zero**. Excluded subscores are renormalised
   away (below), so the opposite reading would mean a candidate improves its
   total by destroying the evidence: delete the part, break the build, hand
   back an STL.
2. **The reference script is the solution; the reference STEP is the datum.**
   Both ship. Scoring compares a candidate against the checked-in STEP, never
   against a freshly regenerated one — otherwise every published number would
   silently become a function of the build123d pin. A slow test re-exports each
   datum and compares it to the bytes on disk (IoU ≥ 0.9999, volume within 1e-6
   relative, every bbox bound within 1e-3 mm), so drift is a red test rather
   than a quiet re-scoring of history.

---

## What is measured, and what is not

**Measured.** Six subscores per task, each in `[0, 1]`, each weighted by
`task.json`: did the target parts *build*, is the resulting B-rep *valid*, do
the task's declared *specs* pass, how much of the candidate is the reference
(*geometry*, a real boolean IoU), does the assembly *interfere*, and do the
part's *metrics* (volume, mass, bbox, counts) land inside the task's windows.

**Not measured.** Style, script readability, tool efficiency, how many turns it
took, and whether a human would like the design. No model reads a submission
and forms an opinion about it. The transcript is published so a person can, but
the *score* is arithmetic over kernel output.

## The commands

```
agentcad bench run     --report DIR [--tasks GLOB] [--set NAME] [--agent builtin]
                       [--model NAME] [--work-dir DIR] [--budget SECONDS]
                       [--skills SEL] [--quiet | --json]
agentcad bench score   SUBMISSION --task ID [--tasks-dir DIR] [--out DIR]
                       [--work-dir DIR] [--budget SECONDS] [--quiet | --json]
agentcad bench prompt  ID [--tasks-dir DIR] [--json]
agentcad bench report  RESULTS [--baseline PATH] [--epsilon F]
                       [--md PATH] [--json-out PATH] [--quiet | --json]
agentcad bench publish LEADERBOARD [-o PATH] [--title TEXT]
```

| Flag | |
|---|---|
| `--tasks` | A glob over **task ids** — `model_from_drawing/*`, `*/mfd_00*`. Composes (AND) with `--set`. |
| `--set` | Select by `task.json`'s `sets` membership. `core` is all 25; `fast` is one task per category, the CI subset. Naming neither selects `core`, so a bare `bench run` keeps meaning the same suite as the set grows. |
| `--agent` | Today only `builtin`, the shipped chat agent. An external agent does not use `bench run` at all — it hands in a project directory and you `bench score` it. |
| `--report` | The results directory to write. A previous run's `tasks/` is cleared first; a non-empty directory that does not look like a results directory is **refused untouched** (`--report ~/Documents` is a typo, never a delete command). |
| `--tasks-dir` | The task tree to load from (default: the shipped `benchmarks/tasks`). On `score` and `prompt`. |
| `--work-dir` | Where a run or a score materializes its throwaway cells, in unique subdirectories it creates and removes. A work dir that **is, holds or sits inside** the submission, the task tree, the results directory or the projects root is refused, exit 2. It is also the **only** path either command grants the confined worker a write into: the task bundle and the submission are read-only inputs, and the worker executes the candidate's own Python. |
| `--budget` | A wall-clock ceiling in seconds. On `run` it overrides `task.json`'s wall budget (never the tool-call ceiling — that is what keeps a task inside one engine turn). On `score` it is a deadline read before every kernel call. Must be finite and non-negative: a NaN deadline is never in the past, so it bounds nothing. |
| `--skills` | Which agent skills the run may load (PRD-029): `all` (default — the shipped library, i.e. what the product ships), `none` (no skills block in the system prompt and every `load_skill` refused), or a comma-separated list of names from the shipped library. An unknown name is a **usage error before anything spawns**, listing what is selectable; a skill a capability gate hides here says so rather than reading as a typo, and a *project* skill cannot be named (the selection is read before any project exists). Recorded in `bench.json` and every `run.json`; `score.json` is untouched. See [Measuring a skill](#measuring-a-skill). |
| `--baseline` / `--epsilon` | Gate a report against `benchmarks/baseline.json`, tolerating a drop of `epsilon` (default 0.02) on the total and on each category. |
| `--md` / `--json-out` | Write the markdown summary (`$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY`, a PR comment) / the JSON report. |
| `--quiet` / `--json` | `--quiet` prints nothing; `--json` puts the document **alone** on stdout, so `agentcad bench score --json \| jq` works. Neither moves the exit code. (`prompt` has only `--json`: printing the prompt *is* the command.) |

**stdout is a contract, stderr is for humans** — the tables and the harness
errors go to stderr, the one-line verdict to stdout.

### Exit codes

| | `0` | `1` | `2` |
|---|---|---|---|
| `bench run` | every selected task ran and was scored | — | harness |
| `bench score` | a score was produced | — | harness |
| `bench prompt` | the prompt was printed | — | harness |
| `bench report` | no baseline, or the baseline is met | **a regression** | harness |
| `bench publish` | the page was written | **a row was rejected**, nothing written | harness |

`run` and `score` are deliberately never `1`: a low score or an over-budget task
is a **measurement**, and making it a failing exit would turn the runner and the
release gate into the same thing. FR11's gate is `bench report --baseline`, and
only there. `publish`'s `1` is the one exception, and it is not about a model —
a leaderboard is a claim about other people's work, so a row that does not
disclose everything refuses the **whole** board rather than being dropped from
it.

Exit `2` keeps `agentcad check`'s meaning exactly: *we could not produce a
verdict*. An unknown task, an unreadable results directory, a refused
`--work-dir`, an incomparable baseline — and the one scoring case,
[every subscore excluded](#the-total).

---

## The task bundle

A task lives at `benchmarks/tasks/<category>/<id>/`; the id used everywhere is
`"<category>/<id>"`. The **bench-v1** task set is five categories,
`model_from_drawing`, `modify_to_spec`, `fix_the_broken_part`,
`assemble_and_clear` and `optimize_under_constraints`, five tasks each — every
one of them driven by bench's own single-turn runner (`bench/runner.py`).
PRD-018 adds a sixth, `generate_from_prompt` (`bench/tasks.py`'s
`GENERATION_CATEGORY`), which is a **different kind of task**: its bundle is
the same shape, but it is driven by the PRD-018 generation loop instead, and
it is scored alongside a one-shot baseline — see
[The `generate_from_prompt` category and the loop-vs-one-shot delta (AC8)](#the-generate_from_prompt-category-and-the-loop-vs-one-shot-delta-ac8)
below. `V1_CATEGORIES` names the original five where a count-guard or a
"the whole suite" claim needs to say so explicitly; `CATEGORIES` is all six.

```
benchmarks/tasks/model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate/
  task.json                       # the rubric (schema-versioned)
  prompt.md                       # handed to the agent verbatim
  assets/drawing.svg              # optional; attached to the prompt as TEXT
  starter/                        # optional; a COMPLETE project directory
  reference/
      project/                    # a COMPLETE project directory — the solution
      steps/spacer_plate.step     # the IoU datum, exported from reference/project
      metrics.json                # the metric windows
  specs/
      project.py                  # optional: injected as <copy>/specs.py
      parts/spacer_plate.py       # optional: appended to <copy>/parts/spacer_plate.py
```

`starter/` and `reference/project/` are **ordinary AgentCAD project
directories** — no bespoke installer, no manifest synthesis. That is what makes
AC1 literally `bench score reference/project --task <id>` with no special case:
the reference is graded by the machinery it defines.

### `task.json`

```json
{
  "schema": 1,
  "id": "model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate",
  "task_set": "bench-v1",
  "version": 1,
  "category": "model_from_drawing",
  "title": "Spacer plate from a three-view drawing",
  "sets": ["core", "fast"],
  "authored_against": "0.1.0",
  "source": {"kind": "authored"},
  "prompt": "prompt.md",
  "assets": ["assets/drawing.svg"],
  "starter": null,
  "target": {"project": "bench_mfd_001_spacer_plate", "parts": ["spacer_plate"]},
  "budgets": {"wall_s": 600, "turns": 24},
  "frame": {
    "align": "world",
    "rotations_deg": [],
    "datum": "the plate's bottom face lies on Z = 0 and its centre is at the origin"
  },
  "reference": {
    "project": "reference/project",
    "steps": {"spacer_plate": "reference/steps/spacer_plate.step"},
    "metrics": "reference/metrics.json"
  },
  "specs": {"project": null, "parts": {"spacer_plate": "specs/parts/spacer_plate.py"}},
  "weights": {
    "built": 0.15, "valid": 0.10, "specs": 0.10,
    "geometry": 0.50, "interference": 0.00, "metrics": 0.15
  }
}
```

The loader (`agentcad/bench/tasks.py`) validates the **whole** bundle before
anything spawns and reports *every* problem at once — fixing one defect per run
is a bad afternoon. It refuses, among others: a path that escapes the bundle, a
`.stl` reference, a rubric that calls `check_fem_static` (the `[fem]` extra is
not a bench dependency), `budgets.turns` greater than the chat engine's
`MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN`, weights that do not sum to 1, more than 8 declared
rotations, and an empty metric-window list on a task that weights `metrics`.

**`assets` are text.** SVG, MD, TXT, JSON, CSV — attached to the prompt inline,
fenced, and named by their path relative to the bundle. There are no PNG assets
in v1: the chat surface accepts a `str` message and adding an image block is a
product change with its own review (see [Seams](#phase-2--3-seams)). The model
reads an SVG as markup, so a drawing needs no OCR and no vision model.

What a generated sheet *carries*, though, is narrower than a draughtsman's:
three orthographic views, the **overall extents** of each view and one hole
callout. It is not a fully dimensioned drawing, and a task whose prompt said
only "model the attached drawing" would be unanswerable. So **the prompt
carries the full dimension set in words** — every feature size, the material
and the datum — and the sheet is the shape, the proportions and the
corroborating overall dimensions. Read the two together, as the reviewer
checklist below requires.

### The rubric

The rubric is deliberately **separate from the reference geometry**, and a
reference part script carries **no `SPECS` of its own**. `specs/parts/<part>.py`
is appended to the candidate's script inside the scoring copy and **re-binds**
`SPECS` — the last module-level binding wins, so whatever the candidate declared
is discarded. Every constructor is imported under a `_bench_` alias, because the
candidate's own module namespace is in scope:

```python
from agentcad.toolkit.specs import (
    check_bbox as _bench_check_bbox,
    check_valid as _bench_check_valid,
    check_wall as _bench_check_wall,
)

SPECS = [
    _bench_check_valid(name="valid", requirement="MFD-001"),
    _bench_check_wall(min_mm=3.0, grid=4, name="ligament", requirement="MFD-001"),
    _bench_check_bbox(within_mm=(80.2, 50.2, 6.2), name="envelope",
                      requirement="MFD-001"),
]
```

`specs/project.py` replaces `<copy>/specs.py` outright for assembly-scope
checks, and when a task ships none, that file is **deleted** from the copy. Only
rubric-owned rows count: `<part>:*` for the parts the injection touched, and
`project:*` only when the task ships a project rubric. A submission cannot
inflate its `specs` subscore by declaring checks it wrote itself.

### Metric windows

`reference/metrics.json` is a closed list of inclusive bands over keys the
kernel already reports — `volume_mm3`, `area_mm2`, `mass_g`, `n_solids`,
`n_faces`, `n_edges`, `bbox_{x,y,z}_mm`, `com_{x,y,z}_mm`:

```json
{"schema": 1, "windows": [
  {"name": "height", "part": "spacer_plate", "metric": "bbox_z_mm", "min": 5.95, "max": 6.05},
  {"name": "material", "part": "spacer_plate", "metric": "volume_mm3", "max": 23250.0}
]}
```

An absent bound stays absent: "no ceiling" and "an infinite ceiling" are
different claims and only the first one is honest.

---

## Scoring

`bench score` never touches the submission. It copies it into a throwaway cell,
injects the rubric into the **copy**, and opens a *muzzled* service over it —
`bus.on_publish = None`, `branch_resolver = None`, `write_guard = None`, the
same three nullings `agentcad check`'s ephemeral service makes. No history
commit, no branch sidecar, `.cache/` lands in the cell, and the cell is removed
in a `finally`.

| subscore | value |
|---|---|
| `built` | `passed / len(target.parts)`, where a part passes when the service builds it. A part missing from the manifest counts as failed, never as an error — and so does a build that **timed out** (`reason: "build_timeout"`) or one that **took the worker down** (`reason: "build_crash"`). Either becomes an `error` only when a `--budget` had already expired, which is our truncation. |
| `valid` | `valid_parts / len(target.parts)` over `metrics.is_valid`. A part that did not build is invalid. `check`'s imported-geometry escape is deliberately absent: a bench candidate that imports a mesh is measured, not forgiven. |
| `specs` | `passed / (passed + failed + errors)` over the rubric-owned rows of one `SpecRunner.run`. A `skip` leaves the denominator — *unless* the candidate induced it (`mesh_only`, `no_instances`), in which case it counts as a **fail** and is named under `detail.skipped_as_failed`. A machine-specific skip (a missing extra) is neither a pass nor a fail. **A zero denominator is `0.0` with `status: "ok"`, never a division and never an exclusion**: `reason: "no_rubric_attached"` when the task ships a rubric and none of it could be appended (the candidate deleted the part, or handed back a mesh reference), `reason: "nothing_measured"` when it attached and every row skipped or the part did not build. Both are the candidate's doing, and an exclusion would renormalise the weight onto whatever is left — the exploit rule 2 exists for. |
| `geometry` | The mean over the target parts of the kernel's IoU against that part's reference STEP. A part with no datum is not scored; a part that resolves mesh-only contributes `0.0` and is named. |
| `interference` | `clean_pairs / C(n, 2)` over the resolved assembly instances. `skipped_mesh` pairs count as **un-clean**: an unmeasurable pair is not a clean pair. Fewer than two instances, with a non-zero weight, is `0.0` — the task asked for an assembly and got none. |
| `metrics` | `satisfied / len(windows)`. A window whose part did not build is unsatisfied. |

### The IoU

One kernel call per part, into `agentcad/kernel/handlers/bench.py`:

* **Only the intersection is booleaned.** `union = volA + volB − inter` is
  arithmetic; `|` on multi-solid Compound operands would double the OCCT
  failure surface for a number already in hand.
* Both sides are **decomposed into solids** and AABB-prefiltered. The pairwise
  sum equals `volume(A & B)` only when each side's solids are mutually disjoint
  — true of a well-formed part, false of one that self-overlaps — so the total
  is clamped to `min(Σ, volA, volB)` and the ratio to `[0, 1]`. Both solid
  counts ride in the result so a reader can see when the clamp could have bitten.
* **A mesh side is never booleaned** (an STL is one welded face and OCCT
  segfaults on it): the call short-circuits to `status: "skipped_mesh"` with
  both volumes still reported.
* Alignment is applied to the **candidate** only, as
  `translate(anchor_ref) ∘ rotate(r) ∘ translate(−anchor_cand)`, in intrinsic
  XYZ Euler degrees. Modes are `world` (default), `com`, `bbox_center`.
  **Scale is never normalised** — a part of the wrong size is a wrong part.
  `frame.rotations_deg` is a task-declared finite list (≤ 8); the maximum IoU
  wins and ties keep the first, so the answer is deterministic.

Volumes come from the worker's `shape_volume` (a sum over `shape.solids()`),
never `.volume`: a boolean result is routinely a nested Compound and
`Compound.volume` reports only the first child subtree.

### The total

```
included = [s for s in subscores if s.status not in ("error", "not_applicable")]
W        = sum(s.weight for s in included)
total    = round(sum(s.value * s.weight for s in included) / W, 6)   if W > 0
```

The renormalised weights are published as `weights_effective`, so a reader can
reproduce the arithmetic without knowing the rule. If `W == 0` — every subscore
excluded — the total is `0.0`, a note says so and **`bench score` exits 2**: no
verdict was produced.

### `score.json`

```json
{
  "schema": 1, "agentcad": "0.1.0", "harness": 1,
  "task": "model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate",
  "task_set": "bench-v1", "task_version": 1, "category": "model_from_drawing",

                 "detail": {"parts": {"spacer_plate": {

                   "rotation_deg": [0.0, 0.0, 0.0], "union_mm3": 23239.00888}}}},
    "interference": {"value": 0.0, "weight": 0.0, "status": "not_applicable",
                     "detail": {"reason": "weight_zero"}}
  },
  "notes": []
}
```

**Determinism (FR6/AC3)**, all of it in one writer:

1. `json.dumps(payload, sort_keys=True, indent=2, allow_nan=False) + "\n"`,
   through the store's atomic write.
2. Every float is `round(x, 6)` **before** serialisation, recursively.
3. `allow_nan=False`: a NaN would serialise as a bare literal no strict parser
   accepts. A non-finite measurement is a `status: "error"` subscore instead.
4. Every list is sorted by a stated key.
5. **No timestamp, host, path, duration or client id anywhere in the body.**
   Those live in the sibling `run.json`. Every path that could appear in a
   message is scrubbed to `<cell>` / `<task>` / `<submission>` / `<projects>`.
6. `harness` is the scorer's version and is bumped whenever a subscore's
   computation changes; `task_version` is the task's. Two scores are comparable
   iff `(task_set, task_version, harness)` agree, and `bench report` warns when
   they do not.

Scoring the same submission twice therefore produces byte-identical bytes. One
honest exception: a candidate whose *own* script raises a message that is not
stable across runs (an address, a temp path of its own making) can make its
zero-scoring `score.json` differ byte-wise. AC3 is a claim about honest
submissions.

## `bench run` — driving the built-in agent

```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-…          # required, checked before anything spawns
uv run agentcad bench run --set fast --agent builtin --report out/
```

**Prerequisite: `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`.** `bench run` drives the shipped chat
agent, which is an Anthropic client, and a run without a key is **refused
before the kernel spawns** (`runner.require_agent`) rather than discovered as a
401 three minutes in. There is no offline mode and no other provider: the one
seam is `runner.CLIENT_FACTORY`, which the tests set to a scripted client, and
it is not a flag. If you have no key, drive AgentCAD from your own agent over
`agentcad mcp` and hand the result to `bench score`.

**`--model`** takes any model id the Anthropic Messages API accepts and is
passed straight through to `ChatEngine`; it is neither validated nor enumerated
here, so a typo surfaces as an API error on the first turn. The default is the
chat engine's own `DEFAULT_MODEL` (`agentcad/agent/chat.py`) — today
`claude-sonnet-5` — which means **a `bench run` with no `--model` measures
whatever the product currently ships**. The id that actually ran is stamped in
`bench.json`, every `run.json` and the report, and a baseline records it, so a
model change shows up as a comparison rather than as a silent drift.

Each task gets a **fresh scratch project** in a throwaway cell under the work
root, with its own service over the **shared** warm kernel. The prompt (plus
every asset, inlined as text) is one user message; the agent works through the
ordinary tool surface; what it leaves **on disk** is what gets scored.

* **The bundled examples are not registered** (`_build_service(examples=False)`).
  A task derived from `examples/rocketry` must not be solvable by opening
  `examples/rocketry`. The **catalog stays registered** — an `assemble_and_clear`
  task legitimately reaches for fasteners, and benching without a shipped
  product surface would measure something other than the product.
* **Budgets live in a client-factory wrapper**, not in `chat.py`: wall clock,
  cumulative tool calls and API turns are checked *before* each API call, and
  the exhaustion surfaces inside the engine's own blanket handler. The turn ends
  cleanly, the transcript stays valid, and the on-disk state is still scored.
  `run.json` records `stopped` and `over_budget`. The real wall bound is
  `wall_s + 30 s + the in-flight kernel request's own timeout` — a call already
  in flight cannot be preempted. The tool-call cap is likewise **soft**: it
  refuses the *next* API call, so the last request's own tool blocks all run.
* **One engine turn per task.** The loader refuses `turns >
  MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN`, so there is no continuation logic. If 30 tool calls
  proves too tight for the assembly and optimisation categories that is a
  *product* finding, reported as `stopped: "tool_calls"` in every affected
  `run.json` — after which the bench measures the change.
* **Serial, and there is no `--jobs`.** The packages build fan-out was deleted
  after failing a pre-registered speed bar *and* flipping a verdict under
  `--budget`; a benchmark whose numbers depend on a worker count is not a
  benchmark. Do not re-add it.

      run.json                   # timestamps, model, host, usage, budgets, skills, stopped
      score.json                 # the measurement
```

`bench.json`'s `tasks` roster is written from the **selection**, not from the
survivors: `bench report` takes its denominator from that index, so a task that
was selected and never scored has to appear there or it would quietly leave the
arithmetic.

### Measuring a skill

`--skills` exists so that *"did this skill help?"* is a measurement rather than
an impression. Run the same suite twice, changing only the flag, and subtract:

```bash
uv run agentcad bench run --set fast --skills none      --report skills-off/
uv run agentcad bench run --set fast --skills snap-fits --report skills-on/

# A report carries ROWS, a baseline carries NUMBERS — one jq filter converts.
uv run agentcad bench report skills-off/ --json-out skills-off/report.json
jq '{schema, task_set, harness, agent, model, agentcad, total,
     categories: (.categories | map_values(.total)),
     tasks:      (.tasks      | map_values(.total))}' \
   skills-off/report.json > skills-off/baseline.json

uv run agentcad bench report skills-on/ --baseline skills-off/baseline.json
```

The last command prints the with-skill score, the without-skill score and the
delta for every scope that moved, and exits 1 if the *with* run came out worse
beyond `--epsilon` — the same gate CI runs against the checked-in baseline. Per
task deltas ride along in `--json-out` / `--md`: printed, never gated.

Two properties are what make the subtraction honest:

* **`score.json` is byte-identical between the two modes** for the same
  produced geometry. The selection is *provenance*: it lands in `bench.json`
  and in every `run.json` as
  `"skills": {"mode": "all"|"none"|"only", "names": [...]}` — `names` sorted,
  and empty for `all` and `none` — and never in the measurement.
* **`none` reaches the tool, not only the prompt.** The engine is given no
  library, so the system prompt is byte-identical to the one that shipped
  before skills existed — *and* the task service's own library is restricted
  to the empty set, so an agent that calls `load_skill` anyway is refused
  (`skill_not_found`, hinted with `bench --skills`) instead of quietly loading
  what the run claims to have switched off. A named selection restricts the
  same surface, so the system prompt advertises exactly the skills you named
  and nothing else.

One task under a stochastic agent is noise. Compare `--set fast` or wider, and
read the category rows rather than a single task's delta.

## The `generate_from_prompt` category and the loop-vs-one-shot delta (AC8)

```bash
uv run agentcad bench run --tasks 'generate_from_prompt/*' --agent builtin \
    --report out-gen/
uv run agentcad bench report out-gen/
```

Every other category asks "can the agent do this task through the product's
tools"; `generate_from_prompt` asks the PRD-018-specific question: "does the
multi-turn **generation loop** (`agent/generate.run_generation` — see
[`docs/architecture.md`](architecture.md#generation-loop-prd-018)) do better
than bench's own ordinary single-turn runner on the same prompt?" A task
bundle in this category (`benchmarks/tasks/generate_from_prompt/`) is the same
shape as any other — `task.json`, `prompt.md`, a rubric under `specs/`, a
reference project + STEP — and it is scored by the same `scoring.Scorer`, the
same six subscores, the same frozen-rubric-`SPECS` injection, the same IoU
geometry. What is different is **how the submission is produced**:

* the **loop** (`bench/generation.py::run_loop_submission`) drives
  `run_generation` over the task's prompt with `Budget(max_iterations=
  task.budgets.turns, wall_clock_s=task.budgets.wall_s)` — the same two
  numbers `bench run` already enforces on the single-turn runner, so the two
  halves are bounded by the *same* task declaration and the delta measures the
  mode, not a budget mismatch — and its **best** candidate's script becomes
  the scored submission (`score.json`, the canonical measurement for the
  task);
* the **one-shot baseline** is bench's existing single-turn `runner.run_task`
  over the identical prompt (`oneshot_score.json`) — the same agent this
  repository already benches everywhere else, run once instead of iterated;
* **`generation.json`** is the pure delta, `loop − one-shot`, per subscore and
  total — `null` for a subscore unless **both** sides actually measured it
  (an excluded/`error` side is never subtracted against, the same rule 2 the
  scorer itself follows), and it carries no clock/host/path, so it is exactly
  as reproducible as the two `score.json`s it is computed from.

`bench report` reads `generation.json` beside a task's `score.json` when
present (every other category writes none, so every other report stays
byte-for-byte unchanged) and renders it as its own table:

```
## Generation vs one-shot (AC8)

| Task | Loop | One-shot | Δ |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| `generate_from_prompt/gfp_001_shim_bracket` | 0.9800 | 0.7400 | +0.2400 |
```

A positive Δ is the loop's iterate-until-green discipline outscoring one shot
at the same prompt on the *same* rubric — this is AC8's "beats one-shot",
measured, not asserted. The task otherwise folds into `bench report`'s
ordinary `categories`/`total` exactly like any other row: `generate_from_prompt`
is one more category mean feeding the overall total, the AC8 table is
additional context beside it, not a second scoring system.

**Selecting it.** `--tasks 'generate_from_prompt/*'` or `--set generation`
(the category's own `sets` entry) runs only the generation task(s); it is
excluded from `DEFAULT_SET`/`--set fast`, so an ordinary `bench run` over the
v1 categories never needs the loop's own client and never pays its wall-clock
cost. `bench run` refuses **before the kernel spawns**
(`generation.require_generation_agents`) when the selection contains a
`generate_from_prompt` task and *either* the loop's or the one-shot's client
cannot be built — both halves need a working agent, or neither runs.

**Offline determinism.** Two test seams, `generation.LOOP_CLIENT_FACTORY` and
`generation.ONESHOT_CLIENT_FACTORY` (the `runner.CLIENT_FACTORY` precedent —
the one-shot seam falls back to `runner.CLIENT_FACTORY` when its own is
unset), drive the whole path against scripted fakes with no network; with them
set, `score.json`/`generation.json` are byte-identical across repeated runs of
the same fake, same as every other category's determinism guarantee.

---

## `bench report` and the release gate

```bash
uv run agentcad bench report out/ --baseline benchmarks/baseline.json \
    --epsilon 0.05 --md "$GITHUB_STEP_SUMMARY" --json-out out/report.json
```

```
task set bench-v1 · harness 1 · agent external · model worked-example · 1 task(s)
  category                          score      n  missing
  model_from_drawing               0.9959      1        0
bench report: 0.9959 over 1 task(s)
```

Pure: no service, no kernel, no network. A **category total is the unweighted
mean of its tasks**; the **overall total is the unweighted mean of the category
totals**. At five-per-category the two coincide — saying it this way means a v2
that adds tasks to one category cannot silently reweight the headline number.

* A **missing task scores 0.0** and is flagged `missing`. With `--baseline`,
  a baseline task the results do not contain is a full regression, listed under
  scope `coverage`. Gating green by not running the hard half is impossible.
* The gate is on **total and per category only**. Per-task deltas are printed,
  never gated: a single task under a stochastic agent is noise, and gating on
  it would make the release gate a coin flip. This is the one place the design
  deliberately measures more than it enforces.
* A baseline whose `(task_set, harness)` differs from the measured report is
  **exit 2**, not a pass. Comparing across harness versions is not a comparison.
* `benchmarks/baseline.json` ships with `total: null` until the first real run
  records one; `--baseline` against a null baseline exits 0 and warns.

## `bench publish` — the leaderboard

```
benchmarks/leaderboard/
  rows/<row-id>/row.json
  rows/<row-id>/report.json      # produced by `bench report --json-out`
```

A row is **rejected** — `publish` exits 1 having written **nothing**, and there
is no override flag — unless all five hold:

1. every disclosure key is present and every string one is non-empty — `agent`,
   `model`, `agentcad`, `task_set`, `date`, `harness_command`, `submission`,
   `transcript` as non-empty strings, `harness` as an int and `config` as an
   object that may be `{}` but must be present. (`schema` and `id` are the
   envelope, checked separately: they identify the document, they disclose
   nothing about the run. `notes` is **not** required and may be absent.)
2. `report.json` validates against the report schema;
3. the row's `task_set` / `harness` / `agentcad` equal the report's;
4. `submission` and `transcript` are absolute `https://` URLs, **or** paths
   relative to the row's own directory that stay inside it and exist there;
5. the report covers **every** task of the declared set — a partial run is not a
   leaderboard row, and a task the report itself flags `missing` is a partial
   run just as much as an absent one.

**Rule 4 is narrower than "repo-relative paths that exist"** (ledger D24): a
relative link is resolved against `<leaderboard>/rows/<row-id>/` and must stay
inside it, textually (no `..`, no absolute path, no scheme) *and* after
`resolve()`, so a symlink cannot walk out either. `../../../etc/passwd` is not a
submission, and the row directory is the only base that means the same thing to
the validator and to a reader of the page. Only an `https://` link renders as an
anchor; a relative one renders as `<code>` text.

**The row's identity is its directory name**, never the document's `id` — a
`row.json` carrying a disagreeing `id` is rejected rather than silently given
two names. An **unreadable** row document is a rejected row (exit 1), not a
harness error: a row we cannot read has disclosed nothing, which is exactly what
rule 1 exists to refuse.

The page is one self-contained HTML file (default `docs/bench/index.html`):
inline `<style>`, no script, no CDN, no web font, no clock reading, no
filesystem path. Rows are ordered by `total` descending, ties by `id` ascending,
so republishing the same input produces the same bytes.

---

## Submitting from outside the repo

Anyone can score their own agent without adding a line of code to AgentCAD. The
agent works through the **MCP server** — the same surface the built-in agent
uses — and hands in an ordinary project directory.

**1. Give your agent AgentCAD.**

```bash
claude mcp add agentcad -- uv --directory /path/to/agentcad run agentcad mcp
```

**2. Print the task's prompt with `bench prompt`.** It writes on stdout exactly
what the built-in runner hands its agent — every asset already inlined as text,
named by its path relative to the bundle:

```bash
uv run agentcad bench prompt model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate > prompt.txt
```

**Do not `cat prompt.md`.** That file is authored for two audiences, and the
reviewer's half sits in HTML comments: the rationale for a weight override, the
reference parameters a threshold was derived from — part of the answer, in
short. `tasks.prompt_text` strips those comments before the built-in agent ever
sees them (`bench prompt` is that function and nothing else), so pasting the
raw file would hand your model a document the built-in agent never gets, and
your score would not be comparable to anyone else's. `--json` emits
`{"task", "prompt", "assets"}` if you would rather pipe it.

**3. Hand the agent that text, verbatim,** and nothing else — no reference
project, no `specs/`, no `reference/metrics.json`. Let it work in a scratch
project whose name matches `target.project` (any name works for `bench score` —
the scorer opens the directory you point at — but matching keeps the two paths
identical).

**4. Score the directory it produced.**

```bash
uv run agentcad bench score /path/to/scratch/bench_mfd_001_spacer_plate \
    --task model_from_drawing/mfd_001_spacer_plate --out /tmp/mfd-001
```

The submission is never written to: it is copied into a throwaway cell, the
rubric is injected into the **copy**, and `.cache/` lands in the cell.

**5. To claim a leaderboard row**, run the whole `core` set, keep the results
directory (`bench run --report out/`), produce `report.json` with
`bench report --json-out`, and open a PR adding
`benchmarks/leaderboard/rows/<your-row>/{row.json,report.json}` with your
submissions and transcripts linked. The five disclosure rules above are checked
mechanically, and rule 4 means an archive you ship in-tree must sit **inside
your own row directory**.

### A worked submission

[`benchmarks/examples/submission-mfd-001/`](../benchmarks/examples/submission-mfd-001/)
is that walkthrough's output for `mfd_001_spacer_plate`, produced by hand
against the prompt the way an agent over the MCP server would produce it: a
`project.json` and one `parts/spacer_plate.py`, nothing else. It is deliberately
**not** a copy of the reference. Two entirely realistic readings differ:

* R4 corner rounds instead of the sheet's R5;
* Ø6.6 holes — the ISO 273 *medium* clearance for M6 — instead of the Ø6.0 THRU
  the sheet dimensions.

Everything else matches, including the datum. It scores **0.9959**: `built`,
`valid`, `specs` and `metrics` all 1.0, and the whole deviation lands on
`geometry`. The two errors pull opposite ways — the wider holes remove ~143 mm³
the reference keeps, the smaller corner radius keeps ~46 mm³ the reference
removes — so 189 mm³ of the two shapes disagree, and that symmetric difference
against a 23 239 mm³ union is the 0.0081 of IoU it loses. Reproduce it with the
command at the top of this document; `score.json`'s
`subscores.geometry.detail.parts.spacer_plate` reports all four volumes, so the
arithmetic is checkable by hand.

That is the shape of the instrument: a near-right answer scores near 1.0 and
the *reason* is a number you can check by hand. A **frame** error is the
expensive one: the same script with the plate's corner at the origin instead of
its centre — a dimensionally perfect part in the wrong pose — measures
`geometry` **0.1369** and totals **0.5684**, with every other subscore still
1.0. Which is why every prompt states the datum in words, and why a task author
who leaves it out has written a coin flip.

---

## Authoring a task

Every task in `benchmarks/tasks/` satisfies all of this, and a reviewer checks
it against the bundle:

1. `benchmarks/tasks/<category>/<id>/` with `id` matching
   `^[a-z][a-z0-9_]{2,47}$`.
2. `task.json` as above. `source` is `{"kind": "authored"}` or
   `{"kind": "derived", "example": "<dir>", "parts": [...]}`. `sets` is
   `["core"]`, plus `"fast"` for the CI subset (one task per category).
   `authored_against` is today's `agentcad.__version__`.
3. `prompt.md` **names the part id the agent must create** and **states the
   datum in words** (which face is on Z = 0, which axis the long dimension runs
   along, where the origin is). This is the frame-alignment mitigation; a
   reviewer reads `prompt.md` against `frame.datum` and they must agree.
4. `weights` are the category defaults unless the task argues an override **in
   an HTML comment** at the top of `prompt.md`. The comment is stripped from
   the prompt the agent sees (`strip_reviewer_comments`), which is the point:
   the argument is for a reviewer. **Never write the rationale as prose** — that
   reaches the model.
5. `budgets.turns <= 30`; `budgets.wall_s` is 600 for single-part tasks, 900 for
   assembly and optimisation tasks.
6. `reference/project/` is a complete project directory whose part scripts carry
   **no** `SPECS` — the rubric lives in `specs/`.
7. `specs/parts/<part>.py` re-binds `SPECS` and imports every constructor under
   a `_bench_` alias. `specs/project.py` for assembly-scope checks. No
   `check_fem_static`.
8. `reference/steps/<part>.step` is generated by the helper, never hand-edited.
   A datum is **required for every target part whenever `geometry` weight is
   greater than 0** — the loader refuses the bundle otherwise — and optional
   below it: `fix_005_invalid_shell` ships one at weight 0.00 (it is still the
   record of what the fixed part is), while the `asm_*`/`opt_*` bundles declare
   `reference.steps: {}` because nothing would open a datum that cost 5.2 MB to
   generate.
9. `reference/metrics.json` is seeded by the helper, then **hand-tightened**: a
   window must be tight enough to fail a wrong answer and loose enough that the
   reference passes with margin.
10. **The reference must score exactly 1.0.** If it does not, the rubric is
    wrong, not the reference.
11. A derived task copies the example's script **into the bundle**; it never
    references `examples/` at run time.

```bash
# 1. write task.json, prompt.md, reference/project/, specs/
# 2. generate the datum and seed the windows
uv run python -m agentcad.bench.author step    benchmarks/tasks/<c>/<id>
uv run python -m agentcad.bench.author metrics benchmarks/tasks/<c>/<id>
# 3. (model-from-drawing tasks) render the drawing asset from the reference
uv run python -m agentcad.bench.author drawing benchmarks/tasks/<c>/<id> --part <part_id>
# 4. hand-tighten reference/metrics.json, then prove it
uv run agentcad bench score benchmarks/tasks/<c>/<id>/reference/project --task <c>/<id>
```

Two authoring notes worth stating out loud. **The weight-override rationale is
reviewer-facing and the agent never sees it**: `prompt_text` runs
`strip_reviewer_comments` over `prompt.md`, so every `<!-- … -->` block (and the
blank it leaves) is removed before the prompt is handed to the model. That is
deliberate — telling an agent "geometry is not scored on this task" tells it how
it is marked and changes what it spends its budget on — so the argument stays in
the file where a reviewer reads it in the diff, and **rationale written as prose
would reach the model**. Assets are attached verbatim, because an SVG's own
comments are part of the drawing. And `author.py drawing` refuses to write a
sheet whose overall dimensions contradict the part it drew (`check_dims=True`),
because the drawing handler's view bounds undersize a curved silhouette; a bench
asset that lies is a task nobody can solve.

---

## Why there is no `bench_*` tool

The bench adds **no** model-facing tool, no route, no event, no error type and
no manifest key. It is CLI-only, and the `iou` scorer is a kernel handler that
`build_registry` never sees — a test asserts its absence. The reason is the
measurement itself: a tool the model can call to ask *how close am I to the
reference?* turns the benchmark into a search problem over its own answer key.
`agentcad/bench/` is also OCP-free by contract (only `agentcad/kernel/` may
import build123d/OCP), which is what lets the scorer run in the same process as
the server-side code it measures.

---

## What this does not guarantee

* **It is a correctness measurement, not a security boundary.** A candidate's
  script is arbitrary Python running in the same interpreter as the spec runner,
  so a determined submission could monkeypatch `agentcad.toolkit.specs`. The
  exposure is bounded to **one subscore**: `geometry`, `metrics`,
  `interference`, `built` and `valid` are kernel-measured and unfakeable, and
  transcripts are published. This is the publish gate's exact posture — a
  correctness gate, never a security boundary — and if a real shortcut appears
  the answer is a red row, not a sandbox.
* **Frame ambiguity is mitigated, not solved.** `frame.datum` is prose in the
  prompt; `align` and `rotations_deg` are mechanical. A correct part in an
  undeclared pose still scores badly, and that is the *task author's* bug, which
  AC1 cannot catch (the reference is in the right pose by construction). The
  mitigation is the checklist above and a reviewer who reads `frame.datum`
  against `prompt.md`.
* **`assemble_and_clear` grades placement as pair distances, and only as pair
  distances.** Every seating relationship the five prompts state in words is
  now a **two-sided window** — `check_clearance(min_mm=…, max_mm=…)`, the floor
  for non-interference and the ceiling for placement — so the v1 "create every
  instance and park them 500 mm apart" cheat is closed: measured, it scores
  0.7375 (`asm_001`), 0.825 (`asm_002`), 0.7375 (`asm_003`), 0.708333
  (`asm_004`) and 0.7 (`asm_005`) against a reference of 1.0, with every
  clearance row red and only `check_interference_free` — correctly — still
  green. What remains is what a *distance between two solids* cannot see: a
  part slid along a face it stays parallel to, spun about the axis its closest
  approach is symmetric on, or lifted inside a running clearance that saturates
  (`asm_002`'s lid holds its lip's 0.15 mm radial gap anywhere within the 3 mm
  lip engagement), and a pair that is **supposed to touch** cannot carry a real
  floor at all, because `min_mm` must be > 0 while a seated pair measures
  exactly 0.000 mm (`asm_003` grades its two contact pairs with a floor of
  1e-12 mm — any floor at or below `_slack`'s absolute 1e-9 cannot fail — which
  is a ceiling with a floor that cannot fail, and leaves overlap to
  `no_interference`). The signal is also **small where the assembly is small**:
  `asm_002` has two instances, so one pair, so one clearance row — the whole of
  its placement grade is `0.35 / 2 = 0.175` of that task's total, which is
  about 0.035 of the five-task category mean and therefore *under* the 0.05
  epsilon the release gate treats as noise. A parked lid is visible on the task, not on
  the category. A rubric row is a measurement between two instances, never a
  pose; `check_stackup` does not change that: it measures worst-case tolerance
  accumulation along a *mate chain* and these instances are placed rather than
  mated.
* **Two product findings bound what `geometry` can measure at all.** Both were
  found by authoring the task set and are stated here because a subscore that
  is silently unmeasurable is worse than one that says so.
  * *Tangent-jointed swept solids are unreliable BOP operands in OCCT 7.9 —
    now detected (changelog 0308).* `fix_005_invalid_shell`'s coolant elbow is
    a swept pipe with G1-tangent face junctions at every bend; OCCT 7.9's
    `BRepAlgoAPI_Common` can silently return a wrong answer for such a pair —
    usually empty, sometimes a negative volume — whatever their
    serialization. The STEP round trip is not the trigger:
    script-against-itself and STEP-against-itself both "intersect cleanly" at
    21 711.685 mm³, but that is operand *sameness* letting OCCT take a
    shortcut, not proof the boolean works — two genuinely distinct
    tangent-jointed solids of identical shape (e.g. two independent STEP
    re-imports) return **empty**, and even a positive result from such a pair
    is order-dependent and not provably trustworthy. `_bop.py` now detects the
    disagreement (an octant-subdivided crop recheck on a suspicious empty) and
    fails closed instead of banking it: the IoU handler raises `KernelError`
    (subscore excluded) and
    `worker.pairwise_interference` marks the pair `degenerate: true`.
    `fix_005_invalid_shell` still weights `geometry` 0.00 and carries the
    weight on `metrics` — not because the STEP round trip fails, but because
    the boolean is degenerate for **every** candidate, the reference
    included, so a geometry weight there would score everyone zero on shape
    rather than surface a real defect.
  * *Generated view bounds undersized a curved silhouette* — **fixed**
    (changelog 0307). `kernel/handlers/drawing.py`'s `_view_bounds` sampled
    each edge at six points, which is exact for a line and wrong for a circle,
    so a sheet's overall dimensions came out under the truth: mfd_003's Ø140
    flange was auto-dimensioned 132.641. It now takes each edge's own bounding
    box, and the same change made `_edge_prim` emit a real two-point line and a
    real arc instead of up to 256 sampled points. `author.py drawing` still
    refuses to write a sheet whose overall dimensions contradict the part
    (`check_dims=True`) — that guard stays live, because a bench asset that
    contradicts its own part is a task nobody can solve and the check is a
    regex.
* **A build that times out or crashes is the candidate's, and it is a zero.**
  Nothing in the scorer shortens a build's own ceiling, so with no `--budget` a
  `timeout` is a fact about how long the candidate's script runs, and a worker
  the build killed is a fact about the geometry the script asked OCCT for:
  `built` scores each 0.0 with `status: "ok"` and `reason: "build_timeout"` /
  `"build_crash"`, and the weights are **not** renormalised. Only a `--budget`
  that has already expired makes either one a harness `error`.
  The crash lane is the one place the harness/candidate split (`error` means
  *we* could not measure) is decided the other way, and deliberately: nothing
  else stops measuring when a worker dies — `SpecRunner.run` treats a
  mid-measurement `KernelError` as a row payload and returns real rows for
  every other part — so an excluded `built`/`valid`/`geometry`/`metrics` would
  renormalise a candidate with one reliably-crashing part onto its passing
  rubric (measured: 0.24 → 0.60 on an `mts`-weighted task). A
  slow-but-correct part is, in exchange, scored against a wall clock the bench
  never declared — the honest lever there is the task's own `budgets`.
* **Per-task deltas are not gated** — see above.
* **A stochastic agent against a per-category gate.** `--epsilon` is the only
  knob and 0.05 on a five-task category mean is loose. The gate is advisory on
  the schedule and blocking on a release branch; many samples per task is
  unaffordable and is not proposed.
* **The optimisation category is constraint-bound, to within the slack each
  row is measured with.** All five `opt_*` tasks now put the optimum where a
  declared engineering row stops being satisfiable, strictly inside the
  `PARAMS` range the script declares, so reading `PARAMS` and typing the end of
  the slider is a *worse* answer than reasoning: measured, it scores 0.925
  (`opt_001`), 0.775 (`opt_003`) and 0.804762 (`opt_004`) against a reference
  of 1.0. That is the authoring rule for any task added to this category — the
  range says what the script can build, the rubric says what the application
  allows, and if those are the same number the task measures nothing but
  slider-reading. What remains is **measurement slack, not a range** — and it
  does not all run the same way, so each task's direction is stated rather than
  averaged:
  * *Slack in the candidate's favour.* `opt_001`'s `check_wall(4.0)` reads
    ~0.2 mm **over** the true wall (a 3.9 mm leg measures 4.094 and is green),
    `opt_003`'s fit floors sit 0.05 mm under and `opt_005`'s `shank_reach`
    0.1 mm under, so a candidate can sit just inside a stated requirement.
    None of it lets a candidate **outscore** the reference — the objective
    windows are one-sided — and a near-optimal answer inside the objective's
    own 5% rung gets full credit by design.
  * *Slack against the candidate.* `opt_004`'s `bolt_circle_ligament` reads
    ~0.4 mm **under** the nominal rim ligament (the grid-4 sampler walks out
    through the 1.5 mm rim chamfer), so an agent doing correct nominal
    arithmetic — a Ø125.0 bolt circle, whose rim ligament is exactly the 3 mm
    asked for — measures 2.387 and is **red**. A row that punishes correct
    reasoning is a task defect unless it is disclosed, so that prompt states
    the overread in its own constraint bullet and tells the agent to keep real
    margin. That disclosure is part of the fairness bar, not a footnote to it.
  A reference must clear its binding row on **designed** margin rather than on
  slack in its favour: `opt_001`'s sits at `thk` 4.05 against a 4.0 floor —
  0.05 mm of real material — for exactly that reason.
* **Contamination.** These tasks are public, so they will eventually appear in
  training corpora. The mitigations are versioned task sets (every score is
  labelled `bench-v1`) and published transcripts (a shortcut is inspectable);
  a **rotation policy adding fresh tasks per release is Phase 3** — designed,
  with `task_set` stamped everywhere it needs to be, and not yet built. Note
  too that a run is not blind: the scratch project the runner creates is named
  `bench_<task_id>` (`target.project`), so the agent can see it is being
  benchmarked and which task it is on. That is deliberate — the name is what
  makes `bench run` and an external `bench score` submission the same shape —
  but it is contamination surface an "unaware agent" claim would not survive.
  Public-and-reproducible beats secret-and-unverifiable for this purpose, and
  we would rather say that out loud than imply a secrecy we do not have.

## CI

[`.github/workflows/bench.yml`](../.github/workflows/bench.yml), deliberately a
**separate** workflow file: `ci.yml`'s shape is asserted byte-wise by
`tests/test_prd006_acceptance.py`, so a bench job added to it would fail a test
that has nothing to do with the bench.

| job | when | what |
|---|---|---|
| `selftest` | every push and pull request, **no secret** | the whole bench suite including AC1 (all 25 references score 1.0) and the STEP-drift check. This is the PR-blocking half. |
| `guard` | always | reads whether `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is configured and emits a visible `::notice::` when it is not. It exists because the `secrets` context is not readable from a job-level `if:`, and a *silently* skipped benchmark is indistinguishable from one that scored zero. |
| `builtin` | `schedule` / `workflow_dispatch` / `push` to main — **never `pull_request`** | `bench run --set fast --agent builtin` then `bench report --baseline`, whose exit code is the gate. Uploads the results directory `always()`. |

`builtin`'s `if:` carries **three** ANDed conditions: the key is present, the
event is not a pull request, and the ref is `refs/heads/main`. The first two are
the trust rule — it holds a secret and executes agent-authored Python, so a
fork's pull request must never reach it (`geometry-ci.yml`'s rule, one workflow
over). The third is the *spend* rule: `on.push` covers `roadmap` as well as
`main` because `selftest` should run on both, and a trigger list wider than the
job's own guard is how a paid run starts where nobody expected one. For the same
reason `cancel-in-progress` is scoped to pull requests: cancelling an in-flight
paid run burns the spend and leaves no result.

`benchmarks/` is resolved like `examples/` and `catalog/` (not in the wheel) and
is in `.dockerignore` along with `out/`, so the task tree never lands in the
image; `out/` is in `.gitignore` too, because a results directory is evidence
to publish deliberately, not a tree to commit by accident.

## Phase 2 / 3 seams

Designed, not built. Each already has the seam it needs:

| item | the seam |
|---|---|
| Launch leaderboard rows (built-in + external) | `benchmarks/leaderboard/rows/` and `bench publish` already accept and validate them; the numbers need real paid runs. |
| A `fem/` category | `check_fem_static` is refused by the loader **by name**; lifting the refusal plus an `importorskip` guard is the whole change. FR3 keeps core tasks extra-free. |
| Task-set v2 rotation | `task_set` is stamped in `task.json`, `score.json`, `run.json`, the report, the baseline and every row; a v2 set is a new directory and a new stamp. |
| PRD-018 wiring | `bench report --json-out` is a stable machine artefact and `--baseline` is the objective function. |
| PNG assets | the chat surface refuses a non-`str` message; widening it is a product change with its own review. SVG-as-text covers every v1 task. |
| Multi-turn continuation | the runner already records *why* a turn stopped; `turns <= MAX_TOOL_CALLS_PER_TURN` makes it unreachable in v1. |
| Voxel-IoU fallback | the handler's `status: "error"` path is already the honest degradation; a second, uncalibrated scorer would be worse than one that says it could not measure. |

## Where the code lives

| | |
|---|---|
| `agentcad/bench/tasks.py` | The bundle schema, `Task`/`Frame`/`Budgets`/`MetricWindow`, `task_problems`, `load_task`/`load_tasks`, `prompt_text`. |
| `agentcad/bench/scoring.py` | `Scorer`, rubric injection, the six subscores, `score.json`. |
| `agentcad/bench/runner.py` | `BudgetedClient`, `run_task`, the transcript and `run.json`. |
| `agentcad/bench/report.py` | `aggregate`, `compare_baseline`, the markdown, the exit code. |
| `agentcad/bench/publish.py` | The five disclosure rules and the static page. |
| `agentcad/bench/cli.py` | `add_bench_parser` / `cmd_bench` — the whole CLI surface. |
| `agentcad/bench/author.py` | The task-authoring helper (`step`, `metrics`, `drawing`). Writes into the repo; never pointed at a bundle you do not own. |
| `agentcad/kernel/handlers/bench.py` | The `iou` handler — kernel-internal, never a tool. |
| `benchmarks/` | The task bundles, `baseline.json`, the leaderboard rows and the example submission. |

Tests: `tests/test_bench_tasks.py` (the loader),
`test_bench_tasks_fix_asm.py` (the `fix_*`/`asm_*` bundles),
`test_bench_kernel_iou.py`
(AC4), `test_bench_scoring.py` (AC2/AC3), `test_bench_runner.py` (AC8, offline
against a scripted client), `test_bench_report.py`, `test_bench_publish.py`
(AC7), `test_bench_cli.py`, `test_bench_author.py`, and
`tests/test_prd024_acceptance.py` (AC1, AC6, AC9, the STEP-drift check and the
workflow's shape).
