# PRD-009 — Sketcher v2

- **Status:** completed — merged to main in PR #13 (AC1–AC7 verified)
- **Phase:** v5 — daily-driver depth
- **Created:** 2026-08-09
- **Origin:** competitive analysis (Aug 2026) + explicit v3 residual
- **Depends on:** — (none hard)
- **Related:** PRD-010 (profiles feed patterns/features), PRD-016 (viewport selection and direct-modeling UX), PRD-018 (generation emits solver-checked sketches), PRD-029 (auto-constrain assistance as an agent skill later)

## Problem & motivation

v3 shipped a GUI sketcher over the first-party scipy constraint solver
(`agentcad/toolkit/sketch.py`, the `solve_sketch` tool, `frontend/
sketcher.js`) that emits clean build123d code — but its entity vocabulary is
points, lines, and circles. The competitive analysis lists "arcs/splines in
the sketcher" among what does not exist (market_research.md, "Where AgentCAD
stands today") and the Gap matrix verdict is blunt: "Sketcher completeness
(arcs/splines) — points/lines/circles — every incumbent — **build**". A
constraint sketcher without arcs reads as a toy, and it blocks real profiles:
brackets with tangent fillet runs, cams, ports, slotted plates.

The gap is doubly expensive here because the solver *is* the agent's 2D
vocabulary — `solve_sketch` is a registered tool, and what it cannot express
an agent cannot draw either. Completing entities and constraints completes
both layers at once. Two adjacent weaknesses go with it: the solver reports a
bare `dof` number but cannot say *which* constraints conflict when a sketch
over-constrains (agents and humans both need the conflicting set, not a
shrug), and drag-editing re-solves cold from the spec's coordinates — the
`initial` argument on the tool is literally documented "unused; reserved"
(`agentcad/core/tools_sketch.py`). Meanwhile the assistance baseline is
rising: Fusion ships AutoConstrain (market_research.md, "The desktop
incumbents"), and FreeCAD 1.x carries a mature sketcher as the OSS bar
("Open-source CAD: FreeCAD, code-CAD, and the Ondsel lesson").

## Users & jobs

- **Mechanical designer (human):** draw real profiles — tangent arcs, slots,
  splined blends — constrain them, drag to explore, and trust the solve not
  to jump to a mirrored solution mid-drag.
- **Constraint debugger (human):** see at a glance whether the sketch is
  under/well/over-constrained, and when over-constrained, which constraints
  to blame.
- **Design agent:** express a full profile as entities + constraints in one
  `solve_sketch` call, read exact coordinates and diagnostics back, and emit
  idiomatic `BuildLine`/`BuildSketch` code into the part script.
- **Generation loop (PRD-018):** a validated sketch substrate — solver-green
  profiles instead of guessed coordinates.
- **Feature helpers (PRD-010):** profiles for ribs and pattern seeds.

## Goals

- G1. Entity vocabulary in **both** layers (scipy solver + GUI sketcher):
  arcs, splines, ellipses and elliptical arcs, slots — with conic sections
  covered as elliptical arcs at minimum.
- G2. Constraint vocabulary on the new entities: generalized tangency
  (line–arc, arc–arc, arc–circle, spline end-tangency), symmetry about a
  line, equal length/radius, concentric.
- G3. Drag-to-solve: warm-started re-solves via the reserved `initial` hook,
  fast enough for mouse-move rates and stable against mirror flips.
- G4. Diagnostics as data: under/well/over-constrained status, DOF, Jacobian
  rank, and — on over-constraint — a conflicting/redundant constraint set,
  in the tool payload and highlighted in the GUI.
- G5. Sketch-on-face: start a sketch on a planar face of existing geometry
  and reference projected edges/vertices as constraint targets.
- G6. Emitted code stays clean, idiomatic build123d `BuildLine`/`BuildSketch`
  — reviewable, portable, no runtime dependency on the sketcher.

## Non-goals

- Full conic primitives (parabola/hyperbola segments) — elliptical arcs
  cover the CAD-practical cases; revisit on demand.
- 3D sketching — out entirely.
- Auto-constraint inference (AutoConstrain-style suggestions) — a natural
  agent task on top of this vocabulary (PRD-029 territory), not solver core.
- A sketch file format — the part script remains the only artifact.

## Experience

**Human path.** The sketcher toolbar grows arc (center, 3-point, tangent),
spline, ellipse, and slot tools; the constraint palette grows tangent /
symmetric / equal / concentric. A status chip reads "3 DOF", "fully
constrained", or "over-constrained (2 conflicts)" — clicking it highlights
the conflicting set in red. Dragging any point or handle re-solves live,
warm-started from the on-screen state, so the profile deforms continuously
instead of snapping to a mirrored solution. Right-clicking a planar face in
the viewport offers "Sketch on face": the sketcher opens in that face's
plane with existing edges ghosted as reference geometry that constraints can
target. Finish emits (or updates) the `BuildLine`/`BuildSketch` block in the
script — the CodeMirror pane shows the edit — and the normal rebuild runs.

**Agent path.** `solve_sketch {entities, constraints, initial?}` now takes
`arcs`, `splines`, `ellipses`, `slots` alongside points/lines/circles, and
the new constraint types. The response carries solved coordinates for every
entity plus `diagnostics`. An over-constrained sketch returns a
`validation_error` whose `details.diagnostics.conflicting` names the
constraint subset to fix — the agent removes or relaxes one and re-solves.
Iterative work (parameter studies, generation loops) passes the previous
solution as `initial` so each solve starts warm and lands on the same
branch. The agent then writes the profile into the part script; the
cheat-sheet documents the entity → build123d mapping.

**Handoff.** A human drags an agent-authored sketch in the GUI; both drive
the same solver over the same spec.

## Functional requirements

**Solver**
- FR1. New entities in `agentcad/toolkit/sketch.py` and the `solve_sketch`
  JSON spec: `arcs` (center + radius + start/end angles, or 3-point),
  `ellipses` (center, major/minor radii, rotation; optional arc bounds),
  `splines` (named control points, fixed degree), `slots` (two centers +
  width, compiled at spec ingestion into the two-arc/two-line composite with
  internal tangency and equal-radius auto-applied).
- FR2. New constraints: `tangent` generalized to line–arc, arc–arc,
  arc–circle, and spline end-tangency; `symmetric {a, b, about}` for point
  pairs and entity pairs about a line; `equal_length {l1, l2}`;
  `equal_radius` extended to arcs; `concentric {a, b}`; arc endpoints
  participate in `coincident` so chains close.
- FR3. Backward compatibility: every v1 spec (points/lines/circles + the 17
  existing constraint types) solves to identical results; existing tests
  and tool payloads unchanged.
- FR4. `initial` activated: `{points: {name: {x, y}}, circles: {name: {r}},
  arcs: {…}, …}` overrides starting coordinates without changing the spec;
  unknown names are a `validation_error`. Solves with `initial` converge to
  the solution branch nearest that start (the solver's documented nearest-
  solution behavior becomes a steerable feature).
- FR5. Every solve returns `diagnostics`: `{status: well_constrained |
  under_constrained | over_constrained, dof, rank, n_params, n_residuals,
  redundant: […], conflicting: […]}` — the conflicting/redundant sets
  computed by rank analysis of the Jacobian at the solution (QR pivoting /
  greedy removal), bounded by a documented time budget.
- FR6. Performance: warm-started re-solve of a 50-entity sketch in ≤ 16 ms
  p50 on a dev laptop (drag rate); cold solve ≤ 250 ms. A benchmark test
  encodes both thresholds.

**Sketch-on-face**
- FR7. The GUI opens a sketch plane from a planar face picked in the
  viewport (the same face-index ordinal `face_info` and the `mesh/faces`
  sidecar use); part edges intersecting the plane project as reference
  (construction) entities the solver treats as fixed.
- FR8. Emitted sketch-on-face code records the face reference in the script
  the way `push_pull` records `push_face(build(p), i, d)` — visible,
  editable, annotated with the face index it came from; the documented
  caveat that face indices can shift under topology-changing parameter
  edits applies and is surfaced, not hidden.

**Emission & docs**
- FR9. GUI emission maps solved entities to idiomatic build123d: `Line`,
  `CenterArc`/`RadiusArc`/`ThreePointArc`/`TangentArc`, `Ellipse`/
  `EllipticalCenterArc`, `Spline`, `SlotCenterToCenter`/`SlotOverall`
  inside `BuildLine`/`BuildSketch`. Emitted scripts rebuild to geometry
  matching the solved coordinates exactly (numbers inlined).
- FR10. Round-trip editing: a sketch emitted by the GUI reopens with its
  constraint spec intact (the spec persists as a structured block alongside
  the emitted code; the code remains the source of truth for geometry —
  divergence is detected and reported, not silently overwritten).
- FR11. The `part_template` cheat-sheet (`agentcad/core/templates.py`) and
  `docs/part-authoring.md` gain the new spec vocabulary and the
  entity → build123d mapping table.
- FR12. GUI diagnostics: the DOF chip and conflict highlighting; a
  mirror-prone drag sequence never flips solution branch when warm-started
  (regression-tested).

## Agent surface

- Changed: `solve_sketch {entities, constraints, initial?}` — `entities`
  gains `arcs`/`ellipses`/`splines`/`slots`; `constraints` gains `tangent`
  (generalized), `symmetric`, `equal_length`, `concentric`; `initial` is no
  longer reserved; the result gains per-entity solved coordinates and
  `diagnostics`. Non-convergence and over-constraint return
  `validation_error` with `details.diagnostics` (including `conflicting`).
- No new tools — deliberately: one solver, richer vocabulary, both layers.
- Routes: `routes_sketch.py` passes the new fields through (whitelisted
  keys per the route-pack contract).
- Events: none new — sketching is client-side until emission, which fires
  the normal `rebuild_started`/`rebuild_finished` flow.

## Technical approach

- **Solver** (`agentcad/toolkit/sketch.py`): extend the residual system —
  arcs parametrized as (cx, cy, r, θ1, θ2) with endpoint derivation;
  ellipses as (cx, cy, a, b, φ); splines as free control points with
  constraints on points and end tangents; slots compile to existing
  primitives + auto-constraints at spec ingestion (no new solver math for
  them). `scipy.optimize.least_squares` stays; rank and dependent-set
  analysis is a pure-numpy post-pass on the Jacobian the solver already
  evaluates. Server process only — no kernel/OCP involvement, honoring the
  only-kernel-imports-OCP rule.
- **Tool pack** (`agentcad/core/tools_sketch.py`): spec plumbing for the new
  entity/constraint kinds, `initial` handling, diagnostics passthrough. The
  `register(registry, service)` shape is unchanged.
- **Frontend** (`frontend/sketcher.js`): entity tools and constraint
  palette; the drag loop debounces to animation frames and calls the solve
  route with `initial` = current on-screen state; conflict highlighting;
  the face-pick → sketch-plane handshake reuses the viewport's existing
  face-picking (the `mesh/faces` sidecar drives it today).
- **Emission:** move code emission server-side into the sketch route so the
  GUI and agents share one emitter (today's JS-side emission becomes a call)
  — a design-spec decision with a fallback of keeping emission in JS and
  documenting the mapping for agents in the cheat-sheet.
- **Tests:** per-entity/constraint solver units; the FR6 benchmark; golden
  emission tests (emitted script rebuilds, metrics match solved
  coordinates); the v1-spec compatibility corpus; a mirror-flip drag
  regression.

## MVP & phasing

- **MVP:** arcs (center + 3-point) + splines + slots in solver and GUI;
  tangent/symmetric/equal/concentric; `initial` warm start; diagnostics
  payload with conflicting-set; DOF chip; emission for the new entities.
- **Phase 2:** ellipses and elliptical arcs (the conic tier);
  sketch-on-face with projected references; conflict highlighting UX;
  server-side shared emitter if chosen.
- **Phase 3:** round-trip spec persistence hardening; 100+ entity
  performance work (sparse Jacobian if the benchmark demands); groundwork
  notes for auto-constrain assistance (out of this PRD).

## Acceptance criteria

- AC1. A slotted cam profile with tangent arcs solves; the emitted
  `BuildLine` code rebuilds to geometry whose metrics match the solved
  coordinates (golden test) — the roadmap's done-when case.
- AC2. A scripted 100-step drag of a cam lobe re-solves warm-started with
  zero mirror flips (test via `initial`); the FR6 benchmark passes its
  thresholds on the bench sketch (perf test with documented limits).
- AC3. Adding a redundant constraint to a fully-constrained rectangle
  returns `over_constrained` with the conflicting set naming the added
  constraint (test).
- AC4. An under-constrained sketch reports `dof > 0` and
  `under_constrained` in the tool payload and the GUI chip (test + browser
  session).
- AC5. Sketch-on-face on the prototyping enclosure's top face references a
  projected edge, emits, and rebuilds green; the recorded face reference
  and its caveat are visible in the script (test + browser session).
- AC6. The v1 spec corpus returns identical solutions; full suite green
  (existing tests untouched).
- AC7. Browser session: draw an arc-slot profile, constrain it, drag it,
  finish — script diff visible in the editor, rebuild green, zero console
  errors.

### Verification (slice 14)

Every criterion has a named test in `tests/test_prd009_acceptance.py`, which
walks it through the surfaces a human and an agent actually touch — the
registered tools, the REST routes and a real kernel build — rather than
through the unit seams (`tests/test_sketch_v1_corpus.py`,
`test_sketch_jacobian.py`, `test_sketch_diagnostics.py`,
`test_sketch_initial.py`, `test_sketch_arcs.py`,
`test_sketch_tangent_direction.py`, `test_sketch_splines.py`,
`test_sketch_slots.py`, `test_sketch_ellipses.py`, `test_sketch_emit.py`,
`test_sketch_drag.py`, `test_sketch_on_face.py`, `test_sketch_roundtrip.py`,
`test_sketch_bench.py`).

| AC | Proving test | Measured |

| AC1 | `test_ac1_a_slotted_cam_emits_code_that_rebuilds_to_the_solved_metrics` — solve the slotted cam through the tool, emit, rebuild through the real kernel, compare against the area from Green's theorem over the **solved** coordinates and the bbox from the arcs' true extremes | volume 1934.65198712 mm³ vs 1934.65198718 expected, `rel` 3.2e-11 against a 1e-6 bar |
| AC2 | `test_ac2_a_hundred_step_drag_over_the_route_never_flips_branch` — 100 warm-started drag frames of a cam lobe over `POST /api/sketch/solve`; plus `test_the_drag_frame_clears_the_fr6_budget` (bench) and `test_ac2_browser_half_evidence_is_recorded` | flips **0**; bench p50 0.45 / 6.72 / 10.12 ms at 8 / 100 / 132 parameters against the 16 ms budget; cold 3.2 ms against 250 ms |
| AC3 | `test_ac3_a_redundant_constraint_names_the_constraint_that_was_added` — the four-case rectangle table, and the QR regression beside it in `test_sketch_diagnostics.py` | the added constraint (#6) is named in 4 of 4 cases; column-pivoted QR blamed an innocent `#3 vertical` in 2 of 3 |
| AC4 | `test_ac4_an_under_constrained_sketch_reports_dof_and_free_entities` (payload, over the route) + `test_ac4_the_dof_chip_is_wired_into_the_shipped_frontend` (structural) + slice 10's browser session | `dof 2`, `under_constrained`, `free_entities` naming the free corners; the chip reads `3 DOF` and pulses 2 nodes in the browser |
| AC5 | `test_ac5_a_sketch_on_the_enclosures_top_face_rebuilds_green` — sketch on the enclosure's largest planar face, constrained to a projected edge, emitted and extruded through the kernel | volume matches 12 × 8 × 2 to `rel=1e-6`; `face N` and `Re-pick the face` present in the script; references contribute **0** parameters |

### As built — divergences from this document

Every item was measured on this branch; the changelog that measured it is
named.

1. **The browser missed the 16 ms drag budget, so the GUI predicts locally**
   (0136). The design's HTTP numbers came from Python httpx (0.72 ms p50 with
   keep-alive). Driven from a real headless Chrome inside the real page, 200
   frames per configuration: connection reuse **is** achieved (0 new TCP
   connections in 600 requests) and the network leg is 4.2 ms p50 on a small
   sketch — but end-to-end `pointermove` → painted is **18.0 ms p95** there and
   **32.3 ms p95** at the FR6 size, because two display-frame boundaries sit on
   the path. The plan's stated fallback (client-side prediction) was therefore
   selected *with the number in hand*: the dragged handle is written inside the
   coalescing `requestAnimationFrame` (8.30 ms p50 to paint) and the solved
   geometry reconciles behind it. AC2's "deforms continuously, no visible flip"
   holds; "the round trip fits in 16 ms in a browser" does not, and nothing in
   this document claimed it.
2. **The plan's ≥ 20× rollback bar for slice 2 was not met end to end: the
   measured figure is 16–17×, and the cause is measured too** (0128). The
   *Jacobian* improved **104×** (9410 µs of finite differences → 90.5 µs
   analytic); what remains is scipy's trust-region machinery (`trf` factorizes
   J per iteration, ~0.9 ms of 2.23 ms) plus the new rank SVD. A bespoke
   Levenberg–Marquardt loop over `numpy.linalg` measures 0.96 ms on the same
   compiled residuals — the design's 0.78 ms figure — and converges to the same
   solution to 7.5e-12. It was **not** adopted: `least_squares(method="trf")`
   clears every budget this PRD names with 5× to spare, and swapping a
   battle-tested solver for 30 lines to chase a headline multiplier is not a
   trade to make silently. `tr_solver="lsmr"` was measured on the drag path and
   rejected (11.63 ms p50 on the staircase, over budget).
3. **Ellipse-to-ellipse tangency and on-ellipse point constraints are
   refused** (0138). The slice-11 spike passed at 100% for line–ellipse and
   circle–ellipse tangency (20/20 each, geometric error p50 9.25e-13 and
   1.32e-10 mm), and those shipped. Two ellipses would need an auxiliary
   anomaly on *each* curve and were never measured, so `tangent` raises and
   says so rather than shipping a constraint that might fail one time in five.
   On-ellipse point constraints have the same no-closed-form problem and were
   already out of MVP for splines; parabolas and hyperbolas remain a non-goal.
4. **The construction/reference toggle arrived in slice 12, not slice 9**
   (0135, 0139). Emission moved to the server in slice 7, so a browser-only
   "construction" flag would have been a lie the emitter never sees. The flag
   is now an entity property in `toolkit/sketch.py` honoured at
   `sketch_emit._members` — the single place that decides what the emitted code
   contains — and projected references get it for free.
5. **`sketch_plane` is a new tool, and the Agent-surface section says "no new
   tools"** (0139). That sentence is about the *solver* surface: `solve_sketch`
   grows keys rather than sprouting siblings, and it did. Sketch-on-face needs
   a way to ask the kernel for a face's basis (`face_info` returns a normal and
   a centre — a plane, but no basis, and without a deterministic in-plane X
   axis every emitted coordinate is arbitrary), and the same design forbids new
   routes, so a tool is the smaller divergence. The count in `docs/agent-api.md`
   went 70 → 71.
6. **Round-trip persistence appends rather than rewrites** (0140). "Re-solve
   from the spec" discards the hand edit *in the sketcher*; the next insert
   writes a **new** block and leaves the diverged one in the script, with a
   toast saying so. Rewriting a range of the editor buffer needs an `editor.js`
   API outside the plan's permitted file list, and appending is what "never
   silently overwrite" actually asks for. The read-only open and the two
   explicit choices are exactly as specified.

   **Corrected (0143).** This entry used to claim divergence detection was
   exact. It was not: the hash covered the emitted code and nothing else, so
   editing a coordinate *in the spec comment* left the block `ok`, and
   `persist_spec` dropped `initial` — so a sketch emitted on the branch a seed
   selected reopened on the **other** branch, also `ok`. The hash now covers
   the spec line as well as the code and the block records an `initial` taken
   from the solution; the spec format is version **2** and a version-1 block
   reads `unverified` (its hash covers something else) rather than `diverged`.
   `_read_spec` also validates the spec's shape now — it used to accept
   `"points": "not-a-list"` as `ok` and let the browser throw.
7. **`tangent` at a junction changed residual form four times, and it is a
   correctness fix, not a tweak** (0132, 0137, 0142, 0143). A residual that is
   second-order flat at a shared endpoint makes the Jacobian rank-deficient
   *at the solution*: a fully-determined slot read `dof 4`, and a GUI tangent
   chain read `over-constrained (1)` with a singular value of 1.8e-16 against a
   8.5e-9 rank tolerance. FR2's tangency is implemented as three residual forms
   (structural handle → perpendicular, pinned junction → direction, otherwise
   v1's distance form). Two pre-existing tests changed with it, both because
   they encoded the defect —
   `test_a_chain_on_the_handles_is_exact_where_a_coincident_tied_one_is_not`
   asserted `nfev` 5 < 17 and became `..._both_chain_idioms_are_exact_since_the_junction_fix`
   (0137's Notes has the diff and the reasoning).

   **Corrected (0143).** This entry used to say the three forms "cover how
   curves meet". They do; *choosing between them* was the recurring bug, and it
   recurred a fourth time after 0142 claimed to have fixed the class. The
   selector was an enumeration each time — entity handles, then `coincident`
   unions, then a table of constraint kinds — and a junction pinned by
   `distance_x(p, a1.start, 0)` + `distance_y(p, a1.start, 0)` is on none of
   them (measured: svals `12.04, 1.41, 4.3e-17`, rank 2 of 3, tangency
   redundant; correct rank 3). `Sketch.resolve_tangencies` replaces the
   enumeration with a Jacobian criterion — the junction's on-curve function is
   zero *and* its gradient is in the row space of every other row — which
   mentions no constraint kind at all.
8. **FR9's constructor list is implemented minus `TangentArc` and
   `SlotOverall`** (0133). Chains prefer **endpoint-anchored** constructors,
   measured: a centre-parametrized arc chain at the GUI's old 6 decimals leaves
   a 7.58e-7 mm gap and `make_face()` refuses the wire. `RadiusArc` and
   `ThreePointArc` cover the tangent-arc case with the two shared endpoints the
   closure gate needs, so `TangentArc` adds nothing but a second way to be
   wrong; `SlotCenterToCenter` covers the slot case and `SlotOverall` is the
   same face with a different dimension. `CenterArc` survives for a full turn
   only, with a warning.

   **Corrected (0143).** "A full turn only" described the intent, not the
   code: *every* `|sweep| > 360` was classified as a full turn and passed to
   `CenterArc`, which raises `ValueError` at 450, and a zero sweep went to
   `RadiusArc(v0, v0, r)`, which raises `Standard_ConstructionError`. The
   closure gate could catch neither — it measures endpoint displacement, not
   whether the call is legal. Both are now refused with a message naming the
   sweep, and the rebuild test walks the range in between. The emitter also
   writes **one `BuildLine` and one `make_face()` per chain**: a single shared
   builder made two disjoint squares rebuild to one face of area 1 instead of
   two totalling 2.
9. **The GUI authors 3-point arcs in centre form** (0135), so
   `arcs[n]["authored"]` is never `"three_point"` from the browser and the
   emitter writes `RadiusArc` — the preferred constructor anyway. The 3-point
   *spec* form is fully supported for agents **on the solver and emitter
   surface**.

   **Corrected (0143).** It was not supported in the *sketcher*: a
   3-point-authored block opened as `{start, mid, end}` and the next solve
   re-serialized it as a centre form with `center`, `r`, `start_deg` and
   `end_deg` all `undefined` — a validation error where the user expected
   their sketch. The canvas has exactly one arc representation, so
   `specToModel` now **normalizes** a 3-point arc into it (its circumcentre
   becomes a real point entity) and it re-emits as `RadiusArc`. Same geometry,
   one representation; `tests/test_sketch_frontend_roundtrip.py` asserts the
   whole pair is an inverse, in node, over every entity kind and flag —
   construction splines and slots and an arc's `fixed_r` were being dropped
   there too.
10. **Spline end tangency is not on the GUI palette** (0135). The solver takes
    it (`tangent {a: "sp1.start", b: "ln4"}`); shipping half of it in the
    browser — with on-curve constraints already a documented non-goal — would
    have been worse than shipping none. Spline control points are ordinary
    points, so every point constraint reaches them today.
11. **`dof` changed value for over-constrained sketches, deliberately**
    (0128). It is `n_params − rank(J)` now; the shipped row count reported
    `dof: -2` for the two-circle tangent-line sketch and a negative number for
    every redundant constraint. FR3 freezes the *keys*, and both fields the old
    formula used are still present.
12. **`solve_ms` was wrong for six slices and the acceptance suite found it**
    (0141). The arc-output loop reused the local name `t1`, which is also the
    solve's end timestamp, so `solve_ms` came back as `(an angle in radians −
    t0)` — about −183 000 000 ms — for **every sketch containing an arc**,
    from slice 5 until slice 14. FR3 freezes the keys' meanings, so this was a
    compatibility break the corpus could not see (it asserts coordinates) and
    a one-sided budget assertion could not see either (a negative clears any
    ceiling). Every FR6 and browser number in this PRD is unaffected: the
    benchmark times the call with its own clock, and slice 10's `srv` column
    was measured on arc-free sketches. Fixed by a rename, with the regression
    bounding the value on both sides.
13. **The diagnostics `analysis_complete: false` path is real and untested in
    anger.** The greedy pass costs 0.30 / 0.72 / 3.50 ms at 50 / 100 / 200
    residual rows against a 50 ms budget (0129), so no sketch this project has
    built comes close to exhausting it; the exhaustion path is tested by
    forcing the budget to 1 ms. When it fires, `redundant`/`conflicting` are
    **omitted** rather than reported empty.

## Risks & open questions

- **Conflicting-set quality:** rank analysis finds *a* dependent set, not
  necessarily the constraint the user considers the culprit. Mitigation:
  return the smallest set found, highlight all members, and iterate with
  real usage; never claim uniqueness.
- **Spline constraint semantics:** on-curve point constraints are expensive
  and ambiguous; MVP restricts constraints to control points and end
  tangents, documented plainly.
- **Warm start vs topology edits:** an `initial` that no longer matches the
  spec (entity added mid-drag) must degrade to cold start with a warning,
  never crash — tested.
- **Round-trip persistence shape** (structured comment in the script vs
  sidecar file): a comment keeps single-file portability but invites
  hand-edit divergence; decide in the design spec together with the
  emitter-location question. Divergence detection is required either way.
- **Solver scaling:** dense finite-difference Jacobians on 100+ entities
  may miss the drag budget; the benchmark decides whether sparse Jacobians
  or constraint freezing during drag are needed — measure before building.
- **Slot compilation visibility:** compiled sub-entities appear in
  diagnostics; naming must keep them addressable (`slot1.arc_a`) but
  grouped, or conflict reports will confuse.

## Competitive references

Every incumbent ships the full sketch vocabulary; Fusion adds AutoConstrain
on top (market_research.md, "The desktop incumbents"); FreeCAD 1.x sets the
OSS bar ("Open-source CAD: FreeCAD, code-CAD, and the Ondsel lesson"); the
Gap matrix verdict is **build** — this is a table stake, not a
differentiator. What we do differently: the sketcher is a thin GUI over a
solver that is *also* an agent tool, so completing the vocabulary upgrades
humans and agents in the same commit; diagnostics are structured data an
agent can act on (the conflicting set is a work item, not a red glyph); and
the output is reviewable build123d code, not an opaque sketch blob inside a
feature tree.
